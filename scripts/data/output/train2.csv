My vehicle will require an MOT on the 12th February, which it will fail because of this, which is will now going to impact on my livelihood.

General information;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hi I?m hoping you can. I bought a jeep last year second hand (2018 jeep renegade). It was an ex motability vehicle and currently has 30000 miles on the clock. I was told I still had some warranty and recently there is a noise under the car that I?ve been told is the flywheel. Could you tell me if this is covered? I can provide my registration etc also  Assistant: Good morning, could you please confirm the vehicles reg please  Visitor: VHZ 8592  Assistant: Just so we can update the owner details could you please confirm your full name and email address  Visitor: Yes sure it?s Rebecca Graham  Visitor: And my email is Rebecca.graham@gmail.com  Assistant: Many thanks for confirming this for me  Visitor: No problem thank you for helping update!  Assistant: Okay, for the Jeep Renegade we have on file linked to the vehicle reg VHZ 8592 - the warranty start date we have on this vehicle is from the 23rd March 2018  Assistant: The manufacturers warrnaty only runs for 3 years and this expired in March of last year  Assistant: When you purchased the vehicle did you take out extended warranty?  Visitor: Ah okay. I bought it in April and they had let me know I had a warranty. That?s annoying. They didn?t offer any extended they said it was manufacturers warranty for 5 years but when I googled this recently I did see 3 years. It was from Arnold Clark so it doesn?t surprise me that they have lied  Visitor: They had said as the mileage was low this would also extend it but I notice yours says whichever comes first  Assistant: Which Arnold Clark retailer did you purchase the vehicle from?  Visitor: Arnold Clark motherwell  Assistant: Also, just to make sure that I am looking at the correct vehicle details, could you please confirm the VIN (chassis number) this is a 17 digit number on your V5 document  Visitor: Would this be in the car anywhere I don?t have the V5 handy as I am out working  Assistant: Okay, the VIN maybe dsiplayed on the lower corner of the windscreen or on a plaque in the door frame. I think what might be best if you double check when you get home the V5 docuement and send a screenshot of your v5 to customer care to confirm the warranty details, as out database (that is not linked to the DVLA) may have the wrong vehicle attached and you may actually have the 5 year warranty  Visitor: Oh I?ve had my mum send it!  Assistant: Even better!  Assistant: well done mum  Visitor: 1C4BU0000HPG54164  Visitor: Whoops helps if I press send hah  Assistant: :)  Assistant: That is the correct vehicle that I am looking at with the reg and VIN confirmed  Assistant: The vehicle only had 3 years warranty with the manufacturer from purchase  Visitor: Ah what a nightmare; thank you for checking  Assistant: however Arnold Clark may ahve sold you the vehicle with their own extended warranty  Visitor: Ah no they definitely said it was the manufacturer warranty  Visitor: They only offer 60 days  Visitor: Not your fault I suppose  Visitor: Il speak to them but I don?t have high hopes for a resolution  Assistant: I see, I am sorry to hear this, Arnold Clark Motherwell is not an Authorised Jeep retailer, I would have crated a customer care case to follow up on this  Assistant: Best option for you is to reach out to Arnold Clarkss own customer care department with regards to the feedback from the selling retailer that the vehicle has 5 years warranty but in reality only has 3  Visitor: Yes I will do.  Assistant: Is there anything else that I can help you with?  Visitor: No thank you that is everything  Assistant: Thank you for contacting Jeep today  Assistant: Stay Safe  Visitor: Thank yoh  Visitor: You**  Assistant: :)"

Visitor: Hi, Stephen Pollard,  Assistant: I can take details and open a case with Jeep UK here, or you can call 00800 0246 5337 or email customercare.uk@fcagroup.com  Visitor: 07802406460, pollard169@gmail.com, bj57 xuo jeep grand Cherokee Overland, thanks Steve  Assistant: OK thank you.  Assistant: Would you be able to provide some details regarding your concerns?  Visitor: Certainly, I had the car serviced, major service at Monza autosport, ashington, within a few days there was significant noise from front wheel, checked this and brake pads worn through to backing plate and disc damaged. They had it back and changed pads and discs, which I was charged for. Have just had problems with turbo noise and errors showing, been checked and it looks like that when fuel filter changed, wiring harness has been dislodged from proper location, seal on turbo intake duct damaged and part of this has broken off, gone into turbo and bent the vanes. The wiring harness has been damaged and is showing faults to all glow plugs. They were supposed to have drained and changed brake fluid, this was charged for, testing shows this has clearly not been done. I am also concerned as to what I haven't found yet. Thanks Steve  Assistant: OK thank you. Can you let me know if you have flagged these issues to Monza and what their response has been?  Visitor: I did with the initial issues with the brake pads, discs etc, they were not overly helpful and tried to minimise this. I have not spoken to them about the rest of it, as to be honest I have no confidence in them or their willingness or ability to fix things correctly.  Assistant: OK, we are happy that you have contacted our team so that we are aware of your concerns with our network retailer. However this is a franchise retailer and would need to be given the opportunity to repsond to a complaint made about them. Our part would be to prompt their managemnet team to respond to your concerns.  Assistant: I would kindly invite you to first discuss your concerns with their management and to let us know if the retailer does not address or respond to you.  Visitor: Ok, I will do that, presumably in writing, how do I copy yourselves in to this. Should I also contact trading standards as well?  Assistant: Our email is customercare.uk@fcagroup.com. I would ask that you first contact the retailer management and give them the chance to respond. If you are then not satisfied then contact us or, if you feel it is appropriate, then contact The Motoring Industry Ombudsmen.  Visitor: Ok, will do. Thanks for your help, best wishes Steve  Assistant: You are welcome, let me know if there is anything else I can assist with  Visitor: Not at the moment thanks for your help  Assistant: Thats ok, have a good day!  Visitor: You too, bye  Assistant: Good bye!

;Visitor: Hi  Visitor: REG - Assistant  Visitor: My car had a new alternator fitter 2 months or so ago. As of Saturday the fault has returned where I cannot turn off my engine and have anything on (such as radio) or my battery drains and will not start  Visitor: The car only has 8000 miles. I am not happy with this and doubting the reliability of this Jeep  Assistant: Thank you for holding  Assistant: in the meantime can I ask for your name, surname, telephone number and email address please  Visitor: Chris McCullagh  Visitor: 07944598569  Visitor: cmccul14@hotmail.com  Assistant: Chris have you contacted Jeep assistance in order to get your vehicle to the retailer since it won't start?  Visitor: I jump started to get it going again, so no this is my first point of contact. As long as I do not have any appliances on when the engine is off then it will start. However I would like this issue resolved as soon as possible. I have had this Car for 10 months and I have already been 6 weeks without it on the last repair  Assistant: Ok so you can manage to drive your vehicle at the moment is that correct  Visitor: Yes  Assistant: Ok then the best thing to do is contact your nearest authorised retailer and they will sort out the issue  Assistant: Do you know who they are or would you like me to give you their details  Visitor: I am happy to do so but I do not think I should be paying for a courtesy car. I appreciate that diagnosis must be performed but this is a repeat issue on a 2 year old car with 8000 miles on the clock. I would expect Jeep to sort this for me on arrival at the garage  Assistant: Unfortunately as you are aware the vehicle needs to be diagnosed first before the retailer can request one for you. This is something that the retailer has to do  Visitor: So you are happy to accept that Jeep will now have failed me for the second time in a few months? This is not good customer service. The last time I had to drive around in a Corsa for 4 of the 6 weeks as Jeep could not get me an alternative. I have 3 kids, one in a car seat. Yet no compensation offered even though I spend £300 a month on owning a Jeep  Assistant: Chris as I said the vehicle needs to be at the retailers first for diagnosis  Visitor: I get that, and I appreciate there is a process to follow but what is Jeep going to do to compensate me for 2 months of the 10 months I have owned the car, where I cannot drive it as it is faulty?  Assistant: Chris at this moment regarding the issue on the vehicle we invite you to take it to the retailer and we will be happy to follow up for you once the vehicle is there  Visitor: Sure, I am happy to do this. I shall be seeking compensation once the car is confirmed a manufacturers fault. What is the point of owning a car if I have no confidence and dont get to drive it?  Assistant: We will be happy to follow up the repair on the vehicle Chris and in order to see if it is a manufactures fault the vehicle needs to be diagnosed.  Visitor: No problem. I can guarantee you it is. We shall speak about compensation once the fault is confirmed. Thank you for your time  Assistant: Please contact customer servcies once the vehicle is at the retailers on 00800 0426 5337 selecting option 2 so they can follow up the repaire while the vehicle is there on site  Visitor: Sure. Thanks

I see the hybrid version of the wrangler is available in other countries. do you know when it will be available here?  Assistant: Good morning, Ill take a look for updates just one moment  Assistant: We do not have information relating to when the Jeep Wrangler hybrid would be available in the UK. The My22 range has been launched and does not include this model. At this stage it is my understanding that this would not be reviewed until at least the my23 range.  Eric: ok thanks, what's the current delivery timeframe ie if i want to roll my current jeep into a new one when my lease finishes, when do i need to start discussing w you  Assistant: The vehicles are produced in Toledo so the factory lead time is extended so we would normally fulfill orders from stock vehicles rather than accept individual factory orders.

Eric: I'll reach out to a dealer  Assistant: The best thing to do is to contact the retailer and discuss availability with the Slaes team  Assistant: *Sales  Eric: Thanks  Eric: Have a good day  Assistant: Thank you, you too!

Comp. Maintenance Coverage & Prices;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hello Again Ana, I am Rubenangel Vitale and I have another query this time regarding the Jeep service  Visitor: Does the service include oil and filter change or do I need to get this additional to the service?  Assistant: many of the scheduled maintenance services require changing oil and filter  Assistant: it depends on the age and mileage of the vehicle (and the type of engine)  Assistant: the link I provided earlier to the Owners Manual portal allows you to download the owners manual for the vehicle you want, and the manual contains a detailed list of operations to perform at each maintenance  Assistant: or are you asking if the service plans include oil and filter changes?  Visitor: Thanks I understand that but my query is, does the ""12,500 Mile / 2 Year Service"" includes oil/filter change or do I need to select the oil/filter change as an extra service to include?  Visitor: yes, the last one  Assistant: ah, I see. It depends on the type of service plan contract. Our Easy Care service plan contracts, for example, say ""For Fiat, Alfa and Jeep Renegade Diesel engine model: services due at 12,000, 24,000 and 36,000 miles or once a year for up to three years, whichever occurs first.* This also includes the first oil and filter change, which could be required outside of the service schedule.""  Assistant: Easy Care service plans are those we have for new vehicles which have not been serviced yet; if the vehicle has already had its first service, we have other service plans called Service Care, the Terms and Conditions are quite similar.  Visitor: my vehicle is new (1 year since I got it from you) and I haven't done any service yet but is due this month. I do not have any service plan but I am trying to book on through you web page https://www.jeep.co.uk/mopar/book-a-service  Assistant: I see; the online bookings there address you to a retailer of your choise, and the options you see (as well as the costs) are those the retailer communicated to our website team that they wanted to make available. So it does depend on what the retailer inserted. Can I ask for your vehicle details, please?  Visitor: I got the option for ""12,500 Mile / 2 Year Service"" and ""Oil and Filter"" as separate services hence my confusion whether the oil/filter is included in the service or not  Visitor: sure, Jeep Compass Reg Number Assistant  Assistant: Usually when a retailer puts in ""Oil and filter"" is a operation which includes just that, and does not count as the recommended maintenance  Assistant: I'll be right back with you  Visitor: sure, no worries. just a not reading your web page it says the following ""Complimentary scheduled servicing by our expert Jeep technicians for 3 years*""  Visitor: should be read as: "" I am just reading your web page it says the following ""Complimentary scheduled servicing by our expert Jeep technicians for 3 years*""""  Assistant: The vehicle does require an oil and filter change at the first service, so I would recommend discussing it with the retailer.

;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I have a second hand Jeep Renegade 2.0lts 4x4 2017 plate and it has been with the dealer for 5 weeks as we are struggling with issues. What it states as the normal miles per gallon on a long run and when driven wisely is 54mpg but ours is only doing 36mpg, this cannot be correct as we would never have purchased this diesel. Please confirm the figures from Jeep for this automatic 2 litres diesel?  Assistant: I will be glad to help you. May I kindly ask for your full name, email address and registration number?  Visitor: I did not purchase from new. The Kings Lynn Jeep dealers advised this is not correct and it is financially ruining us. Autotrader states 54mpg. My email is nethomas@sky.com my name is Neil Thomas and the registration is EJ Assistant  Assistant: Thank you. Let me have a quick check for you.  Visitor: Many thanks  Assistant: Almost there.  Visitor: Thanks  Assistant: Just to confirm is your Jeep 140HP or 170HP?  Visitor: I do not know, it is a 2.0litres automatic  Assistant: That's OK.  Visitor: I would think 140  Assistant: Perfect.  Visitor: should know from the registration?  Visitor: If I drive 55mph to 60mph for example 60 miles distance I only get 36mp gallon when it states 54mpg and this is with no stopping  Assistant: I see. Thank for this info.  Visitor: just checked Autotrader and it should be 140bhp  Assistant: The figures I could find for you are as follows. For 2.0 16V Multijet AssistantAutomatic transmission it shows: ? Urban - 6.7 litre/100km ? Extra-urban - 5.1 litre/100km ? Combined - 5.7 litre/100km  Visitor: I do not understand these figures as need mpg?  Assistant: Let me convert it for you  Visitor: Thankyou  Assistant: For 2.0 16V Multijet AssistantAutomatic transmission it shows: ? Urban - 42.16 mpg ? Extra-urban - 55.4 mpg ? Combined - 49.5 mpg  Visitor: Please can you answer me why mine is only doing 36mpg as we are confused. Is extra urban classed as say a to b on a straight run no stops etc?  Visitor: Our vehicle is with one 60 year old and careful driver but we only get 36.9 maximum on a run according to the trip meter  Visitor: Would this still be expected to be around the same for my 2017 vehicle?  Assistant: In this occasion we would like to have the vehicle diagnosed in one of our authorized retailers and the moment your Jeep is on site we would like to follow up with the retailer.  Assistant: Is your Jeep still with the retailer?  Visitor: no they just diagnosed it over 5 weeks they got one pic at 50mpg but we think Marshalls of Cambridge took it to Jeep dealership Glyn Hopkins in Cambridge as we insisted but we feel Marshalls are lying to us. If you want us to have it re diagnosed please can we go to local Jeep dealership Motorvogue in Kings Lynn as we are still not happy with this mpg return?  Assistant: I'll check for you. Can I have a postal code so I can check for the closest one to you?  Visitor: When Jeep Cambridge diagnosed the vehicle they found 12 diagnostic faults and Oodle Finance had an independent diagnostic check and they only found one error. Marshalls Landrover sold me the vehicle but it has a full service history from Glyn Hopkins Jeep in Cambridge - Marshalls keep saying it is my driving but at 60 years of age and a man who has been on advanced driving courses as I drive 24000 miles per year. We would also need a courtesy vehicle  Visitor: The local dealer is near us and we live at PE32 1NG  Assistant: Thank you.  Visitor: The vehicle miles per gallon is only two thirds of what is stated and I really am a safe experienced driver? We are trying to avoid making a dielsel fuel complaint against Jeep but we are paying so much for me to carry out my business through my company. Also no hills around here as we are in a very flat county as in Norfolk, UK  Assistant: We are very sorry to learn about this.  Assistant: You can contact: Assistant : Assistant : PE30 Assistant01553772644  Assistant: And once the vehicle will be on site please inform us so we can then follow up with you and the retailer to better understand what's going on with the vehicle and find a solution for you.  Visitor: Will Jeep UK be paying for this then and will you please advise Motorvogue I will be contacting them to book it in?  Assistant: When it comes to diagnosis it is not part of the warranty, If dealer will need to do further checks and would charge you, unfortunately we cannot intervene.  Visitor: Do you really need this as it has been diagnosed by Jeep Cambridge and this was as Marshalls Landrover in Cambridge agreed as we are so unhappy with the Jeep. Something has to be wrong, even if and when my wife drives we are only getting 36mpg  Visitor: Sorry so what are you saying Jeep want us to have it diagnosed but we need to pay for it?  Visitor: hello?  Assistant: In order for us to better assist you the vehicle needs a recent diagnosis at least last 24hr, max 48hrs. And diagnosis can be chargeable and it is set by the retailer and we cannot intervene.  Visitor: we are not prepared to pay this but Jeep dealer in Cambridge diagnosed this vehicle just last week so you could ask them for the full diagnostic report surely as it is your Jeep UK dealership who recently carried this out?  Assistant: Unfortunately it won't help Mr Thomas because the diagnosis needs to be recent max. 48hr especially in such cases when you are experiencing issues with the consumption.  Visitor: We had the consumption issues since day one of purchasing (along with many others), we have been refusing to pay the finance due to this which has been ongoing since four or five months of ownership?  Assistant: I understand Mr Thomas but this diagnosis is necessary for the case to be escalated further to the main office. ( 1h 3m 50s ) Visitor: I cannot afford to pay for this as cannot afford it so as it is with the UK Financial Ombudsman we will wait for them and in the meantime we will speak with a legal company and lodge a claim against Jeep UK for false claims reference what is stated and what our Jeep gives by means of return. This will obviously be bad press for Jeep but we are sick and tired of being fobbed off. This may ignite thousands of claims against Jeep UK for mileage falsification as we are being bankrupted by a terrible mpg returns. We wish to avaoid this but will move forward if nothing is being done. You build the vehicles so by law you are responsible for performance issues as a group? ( 1h 8m 34s ) Visitor: hello? ( 1h 10m 34s ) Visitor: Hi, please would you respond ( 1h 12m 33s ) Assistant: I understand Mr Thomas but we won't be able to assist you with an old diagnosis. ( 1h 13m 6s ) Assistant: Because it won't have recent relevant details to consider and help with the issue. ( 1h 14m 8s ) Visitor: I have only driven the vehicle 120 miles since it was diagnosed by a Jeep specialist? ( 1h 14m 42s ) Visitor: Please would you email me those miles per gallon expected on a Jeep letterhead ( 1h 15m 32s ) Visitor: Of course it will have a relevant diagnosis as only recently finalised after five weeks ( 1h 16m 24s ) Assistant: Of course. In the email the consumption will be in Litre/100Km because the conversion to mpg was done by me for you to easily understand what it is like in mpg, so in the email you will find it in Liter/100Km. ( 1h 18m 40s ) Visitor: Ok fine thanks and I will add your conversion. One thing learnt here is that I will never ever buy another Jeep nor recommend it to anyone. We love the car but the consumption and lack of support is key to us and we are victims of a major fault and will now take legal action for false mileage data to the consumer and claim thousands of pounds in damages ( 1h 18m 50s ) Assistant: We are very sorry and apologise for any inconvenience caused. And please understand us that a very recent diagnosis is crucial to help with such issues. ( 1h 22m 19s ) Assistant: Mr Thomas will it be possible to have a phone call now? ( 1h 24m 57s ) Visitor: We do not agree with Jeep and what you state as it was checked for the mileage by a Jeep specialist just last week. This proved the faults x 12 diagnosed by Jeep Cambridge were all fixed but the low mileage performance was still terribly low and therefore that data is already in existence. You are simply covering up and you were being helpful to start with and now as we refuse to accept this we feel you are siding with the Jeep dealer but my grievance is with Marshalls Landrover of Cambridge as they say it is now doing 50mpg on a run which is a lie. I will now seek legal advice and ask other Jeep dealers whether they are also getting very low mpg returns and we can all make a substantial damages claim against Jeep UK as we have been mis sold to, You really need to make your management team aware we are going public concerning Jeep and exaggerated fuel returns ( 1h 25m 38s ) Assistant: Mr Thomas will it be possible to have a phone call now? ( 1h 26m 28s ) Visitor: yes ok 07915602103 ( 1h 26m 41s ) Assistant: Thank you. I am calling you now.

Part in backorder/not available;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hi John. I bought a second hand Jeep in September last year, so only 4 months ago. It?s now in the garage as it has a fault sensor but they?re saying they can?t give me another car and the replacement part won?t be available for another week at least. Where do I stand with this?  Assistant: Okay, could you please confirm for me the vehicles registration plate and the name of the authorised Jeep retailer that your vehicle is on site with?  Visitor: Reg is Assistant. It?s with PDH cars in Hassocks  Assistant: Thanks  Assistant: And where did you buy the vehicle from last September?  Visitor: I didn?t buy it from this garage as the garage I bought it from is 2 hours away. It was from Jeep Lipscomb  Visitor: PDH is my local garage  Assistant: I see, could you please confirm your full name, mobile phone contact and your email address please?  Visitor: Hannah Moss, 07734599105 and hannahclairemoss@hotmail.com  Assistant: Thanks for confirming this  Assistant: did Jeep Lipscomb sell you the vehicle with an extended warranty?  Visitor: Yeah with a years Jeep Warranty  Assistant: I see, okay, as the manufacturer mobility was provided with this vehicle to keep the driver mobile should the vehicle be rendered off of the road, but this was during the original manufacturers warranty, this policy expired as of the end of September this year  Assistant: We as the manufacturer will not be able to keep you mobile if PDH does not have a vehicle to supply  Assistant: I do apologise  Visitor: Do you mean September last year?  Assistant: Sorry, September last year  Visitor: I get that it can?t be done under the warranty as I spoke to someone earlier who said I could possibly claim back a hire car cost. What I?m asking is if the garage should be supplying me a car? They?ve already messed me round for a week trying to get the car in and I can?t be without a car for another week. Not a great impression of Jeep after only owning the car 4 months  Assistant: I understand, our retail network of Jeep retailers only have a finite amount of courtesy vehicles available for customers to be kept mobile, if they do not have one available for customers then a hire vehicle request is submitted by the retailer for an Enterprise rental vehicle to be provided to keep the driver mobile, but this only within the original vehicles warranty is this contract valid  Assistant: When the vehicle is outside of the mobility contract, if the retailer has not got a courtesy vehicle available, we as the manufacturer can only enquire with the retailer about this, but cannot force the issue to keep you mobile  Assistant: I am in the process of opening a customer care case to follow up on the repair and once assigned to a case manager they will be in contact with the retailer and yourself to follow up on the repair and ensure your vehicle is returned as quickly as possible  Visitor: Thank you. Do you know when that will be? I?m conscious it?s nearly the weekend and then nothing will be done until next week. I have two young kids and a job so rely on my car  Assistant: I cannot say for certian when the case will be assigned, but this has been escalated for a case manager to look into  Assistant: Is there anything else that I can help you with?  Visitor: Ok thank you.  Visitor: That?s all thanks  Assistant: Thank you for contacting Jeep today  Assistant: Stay Safe

Visitor: They just say the courtesy car is unavailable  Visitor: and they can't say if they can check my car today  Visitor: But my car is only 4 months old from brand new  Visitor: would the e-brake not warrantable?  Visitor: the e-brake not released at all  Assistant: I am not technically trained, but for a vehicle that age sounds like a warrantable concern to me, I will prompt the case to follow up on this and chase the retailer to find out why they are not submitting a hire vehicle request to keep you mobile  Assistant: Is there anything else that I can help you with at all?  Visitor: Please help me understand  Visitor: Does the retailer need to check the car first and submit the courtesy car request?  Visitor: or they can submiy before checking the car?

Visitor: they just said countesy car cannot be arranged  Visitor: i asked where I can rent a car by myself  Visitor: she pointed me a direction for car rental  Visitor: I am not sure if I should rent a car now  Visitor: as I am waiting next to the retailer from this morning until now  Assistant: If you chose to rent a car yourself, we the manufacturer will not pay for this, as the mobility contract can only provide a hire vehicle through the retailer submitting the request  Visitor: The thing is I am not sure how long I need to wait  Assistant: I think the best course of action is if you make direct contact with Glyn Hopkins and request to speak with the service manager directly to find out why they are not submitting this request, especially as you have purchased the vehicle from Gyn Hopkins themselves  Visitor: My question is does Glyn hopkins need to check my car first to submit a request?

-;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?

Assistant: Would you be able to provide me with your name, registration number and contact email and phone number please?

Visitor: I wish to make a complaint about one of your partner dealerships Ian Grieve Falkirk. I had my Jeep Compass into them at the end of last year to reset a fault after an oil change, however it was then found that my car had a rusted plug so that got replaced, however since my car has been in for that I ended up having more faults with it, these being the car intermittently not starting, my start stop not working and a service ECS system fault intermittently coming up. Following this I took the car back into them and explained the issues I had been having and said I was assuming it was the battery as it didn?t seem to be charging whilst I was driving no matter how long I was driving for, when I told them this they assured me that there was just a rusted battery terminal and that they had cleaned it, given the car 4 software updates and that should fix it. I then ended up coming out of my night shift at the hospital and the car wouldn?t start, I contacted Ian grieve again to let them know about this and they told me that I was to either tow the car to them or to get it jump started, I got a jump start and took it in and now I am being informed that the jump start I got has caused such severe damage that the battery needs replaced but that I now need to pay for this. I have also been left with no car and no curtesy car for 4 days now which is not ideal when you have young children and a job to get to and no other car in the household. I am of course extremely annoyed by this as I got a Jeep for the brand and reliability of the car and I feel it?s just been problem after problem since it being into this garage, I have been seriously let down by a supposed Jeep ?expert? garage.  Assistant: OK thank you, just one moment  Visitor: No bother  Assistant: Where is the vehicle at the moment and is it still waiting for authority for repairs?  Visitor: It is currently at Ian Grieve Falkirk and yes it?s still waiting on repairs, they contacted me this morning telling me that the battery needs replaced before they can find out if there are other faults so I had to tell them to replace the battery as I need my car back  Visitor: As soon as possible  Assistant: What is the current mileage more or less  Visitor: I?m sure it?s around 27500/28000  Assistant: OK thank you, also can you let me know who you have spoken to at the retailer?  Visitor: Yes of course initially it was the receptionist of the service department and since then it has been a man called Adam I have dealt with  Visitor: I?m not sure what his role is as he hasn?t told me  Assistant: OK thank you, I will have a case opened for you  Visitor: Thank you so much, I appreciate it  Assistant: 01220048

I am looking for help regarding an issue with our Jeep and trying to find a garage that could check why the multifunction indicator light is on.  Assistant: Hi Fiona good morning  Assistant: In the meantime can I ask for your surname, telephone number, email address, vehicle registration number and postcode please so I can tell you where your nearest Jeep retailer is please  Visitor: You can. Turpin. PE65HFR, 07722331904, fi.turpin@gmail.com and PR7 6LH  Visitor: However, the reason for contacting you is that our nearest Jeep service garage in Preston can't look at the car until later in February - even to do a diagnostics test on why the light is on  Visitor: Leaving us unsure whether it will therefore cause damage or otherwise be unwise to take the car away next week when we are booked for 4 nights to celebrate my birthday  Assistant: I have just confirmed and they are your nearest retailer and the second one on the dealer locator is in Liverpool  Assistant: Unfortunately we cannot assist in getting the vehicle looked at before the end of February  Visitor: So, my research suggests that the malfunction indicator light can come on for reasons ranging from inconvenient through to potentially serious. It is a real problem! Do we need a Jeep dealer to carry out the diagnostics? We have been led to believe this to be the case.  Assistant: Exacly Fiona, If a customer has an issue with the vehicle they need to contact a retailer and get them to look at the vehicle and sort this out for customer. In the meantime I see that your vehicle is a 2015 vehicle so you don't have Jeep assist any longer which was for the 1st three years, otherwise you could've contacted them to have a look at the vehicle but that expried in 2018  Visitor: Unfortunately not. We do have Green Flag. We should have changed the car earlier last year but we are still waiting for one that was put on order. How frustrating! Would there be any merit in contacting Green Flag or is that something you would not know (understandable - but worth asking in view of how this could affect my 60th birthday plans)....  Assistant: Try and contact them, if you have a warning light on the dashboard and see what they say. Regarding getting your vehicle looked at before the retailers booking date we cannot help you  Visitor: Okay, thanks. I understand. But it is so frustrating.

Visitor: Please can someone ring me for case number 01302400. I have been in contact 3 times and have not had a response.

Visitor: Yes  Assistant: I am not your case manager, but can I call you now?  Assistant: on 07549939345  Visitor: When would my case manager be available?  Assistant: On Monday. But I can see that he has a few question for you  Assistant: Can I ask them now?  Visitor: Yeah, that?s fine  Assistant: First off, we are obviousely very sorry that you vehicle has not been delivered on time.  Assistant: What was teh original delivery date?  Assistant: Was this given verbally or is it written in a sales contract?  Visitor: The delivery date wasn?t the problem. The car was delivered but it was missing the extras I paid for, mainly the glass roof  Visitor: I had to fight with my provider to have the correct vehicle and not wait another 16 weeks. They found me the correct one but it has the added on audio package which I will be receiving on tuesday  Visitor: However I am being charged for this audio package which I did not order and it is not my fault that the vehicle they are using to compensate the mistake has the added package. I would remove it if possible but I have been told this is not possible and I will have to pay for this package I did not want  Assistant: I understand. Thank you very much for explaining. So you have now recieved the correct type of vehicle, but due to this problem you are asked to pay extra for the audio package. So the main problem that remains is the cost of the audio package, which you do not need  Assistant: Who Is your direct contact within the retailer?  Visitor: Yes that is correct. However I want to note that rather than being compensated for the mistake I am being charged and in addition have had to wait a further 4 weeks for my new vehicle. I?ve also had to find answers to all these problems myself rather than having it sorted by jeep or the sales company. I have had no customer support or service regarding the original mistake  Visitor: His name is Darren at Stoneacre  Visitor: He has tried his best and been very empathetic to my situation however his hands have been tied by his manager  Assistant: We are very sorry that we haven't been able to assist you better until now, but we will do our best to help find a solution to this problem.

Assistant: I can see that is also missing  Visitor: I have been told I?ll be given it on monday  Visitor: I still have not received the vehicle  Visitor: I?ve been told I can pick it up on tuesday  Assistant: Understood. I can see the urgency too  Assistant: Can we reach you via telephone monday? It seems we have not had muh luck with that  Assistant: Please keep in mind that we are calling from Italy  Visitor: It?s upsetting that in order to get my new car that I?ll have to pay more money on Tuesday.

I have messaged 3 times asking for a return call  Assistant: I can see that you have tried and also your case manager has tried to reach you.

The car has been with a garage for some time who have said the rear differential has a hole in it and has leaked all of it's fluid, and will require replacement. The 'hole' they have found I'm the differential casing they said looks to babe been 'drilled', however I have driven the bar for a year without issue, and the car has not been modified or tampered with in that time.

-;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hi i contacted jeep uk yesterday case reference 01211663 and was wondering what the latest is? Thanks  Assistant: I'll have a look and I'll be right back with you  Assistant: have you taken the vehicle to the retailer with regards to your tyre? We can only investigate this matter when the vehicle is there at the retailer, or if it has been to the retailer recently for the matter at hand  Visitor: No i tried contacting arnold clark but the customer services just tell me to go to call the branch and book it in but the branch is 80 miles from where i live. There is another about 10 miles away which would be ideal but they are telling me to call them rather than booking it in for me. Im not explaining myself to another branch and wasting time taking time off work to go there and sit all day waiting on them looking at it. I use my car every day for work and after supposedly doing the alignment last year my passenger tyre is nearly bald on the outside. I use my car every day for work and have a young family and cant be without a car  Assistant: I see Arnold Clark Linwood as being your closest branch; I would recommend contacting them as Customer Care cannot schedule a booking for you (the team does not have the retailer's schedule or your own schedule). If the vehicle is unsafe to drive or suffers a breakdown, you can also call Roadside Assistance on 00800 0426 5337 (option 1) to recover the vehicle to the retailer for you  Visitor: I understand that but if i was to get the car taken away will a replacement be given? We also have a family holiday next week and will be doing over 1000 miles and im really nervous about not getting this sorted in time as the car would not be fit for it. I have asked them to call me back and waiting but im not happy that it is not being excelated given its unnecessary work for a new car that already had alignment done  Visitor: Thats not to mention the rattles of the door, the stop start does not work and the battery is nowhere near full capacity despite long drives  Assistant: If the vehicle is recovered by Roadside Assistance outside of retailer opening hours, you can request a courtesy car from Raodside Assistance; if the vehicle is recovered to the retailer while they are open, the retailer will carry out the diagnostic and request a courtesy vehicle if the repair cannot be carried out within a few hours  Assistant: Unless the vehicle is deemed ""off the road"", you must make an appointment with the retailer; Customer Care cannot change the retailer bookings to give you an earlier appointment as this would mean the retailer would not be able to meet the appointments they have made to other customers"
Part in backorder/not available;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hello, my car broke down yesterday after only having it for two weeks. An recovery was set up by yourselves and has now been sent to my local garage I would like to be informed of the next steps  Assistant: the retailer will be able to tell you who long they need to have your vehicle repaired, and whether they have requested parts or technical assistance from our Head Office  Assistant: I?m very sorry you are having this experience with a new Jeep  Assistant: has the retailer advised you whether they have completed the diagnostic?  Visitor: I have spoke with the garage and it appears that the clutch will have to be replaced along with other parts  Visitor: My biggest concern is will this all be covered by yourselves?  Assistant: depends on the cause, our warranty only covers manufacturing defects. If the clutch was damaged by external sources, or it the damage is due to wear and tear the warranty may not apply.  Assistant: Can you please give me the vehicle details? Registration, VIN, mileage  Assistant: If the vehicle is only 2 weeks old, it would not be normal wear and tear, but the retailer must rule that out to submit a warranty claim  Visitor: I collected the car on the 5th of February  Assistant: If you want Customer Care to follow up on this, I will be happy to open a case for you  Visitor: My reg is SR71PHF  Visitor: Yeah I would thank you  Assistant: can you confirm the reg? it's not coming up on my database  Assistant: If you have the Assistantwill certainly be able to find it even if the vehicle has only been registered recently  Visitor: What is the VIN number?  Visitor: When I called in yesterday they had issues finding the car as it was so new so was not on the database  Assistant: the VIN is the vehicle identification number; it's a long code with 17 digits, effectively it works as the serial number for each car  Visitor: Where can this be found as I?m not currently with the car as it?s in the garage  Assistant: it will be on your sales invoice,, and on your V5C  Assistant: naturally it's also on the vehicle itself (usually by the end of the windscreen) but I understand you do not have the vehicle with you as it broke down  Visitor: 1C4NJCE35MPN37547  Assistant: thank you. Are you able to verify the registration number? I have a reg on the system for this VIN but it is a little bit different from the one you provided  Visitor: SD71PHF  Assistant: ah, yes, that one is correct  Assistant: can I please have your contact details so that we can contact you back about this case?  Visitor: Alyse Hay  Visitor: 07983545759  Visitor: alysehay@hotmail.com  Assistant: thank you  Assistant: Which retailer was your Jeep taken to?

Visitor: Yes that?s not a problem at all  Assistant: Your case number is 01192621  Assistant: I will escalate this now, and a case manager will be assigned to your request as soon as possible  Visitor: That?s perfect thank you so much  Assistant: they will contact both yourself, the retailer, and any other department in Jeep that may need to be involved (warranty, ofr example, or technical services, or parts support)  Assistant: Can I help you with anything else?  Visitor: That?s perfect. Thank you so much for your help it?s much appreciated  Assistant: Thank you for contacting Jeep today, for any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us again.

However no we would not be in a position to upgrade the vehicle to a 4xe.  Visitor: So how can jeep possibly still be selling compass in the UK if it isn't allowed? I am really upset and yes frustrated. Something really has to be done to smooth this over  Visitor: This isn't just down to not getting the car, this goes way before that. I feel jeep need to recognise my personal story and journey with the whole process  Assistant: The issue itself is in the process of being resolved and while the vehicle cannot be registered the vehicle would not actually be being sold I would imagine. When we have resolved the issue I would be happy to discuss your experience with our brand.  Visitor: So I have to wait who knows how long until the issue is sorted? I feel the experience I have had warrants a high manager calling me to discuss absolutely everything and talk about what will be done.  Assistant: Your concerns have of course been flagged to senior management, however the Customer Care team are the customer facing team for the brand and would always be the contact with the customer.  Visitor: Like I say, if I could get a call from someone to talk about the issues I have had, then give me some sort of idea to what the company will do to retain me would be nice.  Assistant: I will request further update and call you again to discuss our position in the coming days.  Visitor: Thank u  Assistant: Thats ok, ill let you know how we get on.

-;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: hi, I purchased a second hand Jeep Renegade around 2 months ago and the stated mpg returns for driving long haul states 54mpg yet with very careful long haul driving my Jeep is only doing 36mpg - This is terrible and even the Jeep dealers are stunned? Why is this happening please as I would not have purchased the vehicle if it stated 36mpg?  Visitor: EJ17ZYF  Visitor: hello?  Assistant: Im not sure I understood your inquiry, I do apologise  Assistant: when you say ""driving long haul"", do you mean when pulling a carriage behind it?  Assistant: can you kindly rephrase?  Visitor: no just on a long direct main road averaging 60mph a to b no city driving  Assistant: do you intend to say that the speedometer doesnt show the correct speed at which the vehicle is travelling?  Visitor: No the miles per gallon is far lower than your statistics show. Jeep show 54mpg but my Jeep only gets 36 miles per gallon and using far to much fuel  Assistant: I will take a look into that  Assistant: in the meantime, may I have your full name, email and phone nr. to log this interaction?  Visitor: Reg EJ17ZYF. My email is nethomas@sky.com Name is Neil Thomas. Mobile 07915 602 103 (UK). I have to leave for work, would you please email me once you have investigated please?  Assistant: thank you for the details  Assistant: I'd suggest sending the vehicle to an authorised workshop for inspection if you suspect an anomaly with the fuel consumption.  Assistant: I can find the closest ones in your area if you can give me your postcode  Visitor: I am not prepared to pay for this. I have just had a diagnostic report carried out this morning by my loan company but no errors showed up. I think I need to ask Jeep if the 54mpg advertised and stated by Jeep is genuine?  Visitor: I know where the Jeep dealer is in Kings Lynn Norfolk but Jeep advertise 54mpg but I only get 36? Why?  Assistant: The type of route, traffic conditions, weather conditions, driving style, general condition of the vehicle, use of the climate control system, vehicle load, presence of roof racks and other situations that adversely affect the aerodynamics or wind resistance lead to different fuel consumption values than those measured.  Visitor: Office of Fair Trading need to be made aware Jeep advertising 54 and the vehicle only achieves 36 mpg and this is financially ruining us  Assistant: in order to determine whether there's a fault, the vehicle would need to be inspected by our technicians  Visitor: What a load of rubbish. I am 60 years of age and the vehicle is standard, 1 person within and driven very well. So do you test the vehicles with no roof rsils to get 54mpg, do not fob me off  Visitor: I will take it to Jeep, Motorvogue in Migs Lynn but Jeep can pay  Visitor: in Kings Lynn  Assistant: that would be the best course of action  Assistant: and if you need our assistance afterwards, dont hesitate to contact us again  Visitor: So are Jeep UK going to pay for the check to be carried out because there is something wrong here. Do not try to tell me it will do 18mpg less than that stated in the Jeep literature because of the roof rails, the weather, I drive conservatively  Assistant: The inspection will incur a fee as the vehicle is currently out of it's warranty  Assistant: However, if you would like Jeep to contribute towards the repair costs, we can forward the request to the relevant team but first the vehicle would need to be diagnosed  Visitor: So do I advise the Jeep main dealer to invoice Jeep UK for this check, otherwise I will sue for damages and have the fuel economy investigated by a government specialist. As you are aware many manufacturers are having to pay substantial damages for false technical statements  Visitor: No, it is under warranty from Marshalls of Cambridge who I purchased from but they are Landrover and not got the correct diagnostic equipment. Jeep should pay or I will sue for damages due to incorrect technical information concerning fuel economy in their literature  Assistant: We wouldn't be able to offer further assistance, if the vehicle is not diagnosed at one of our authorised workshops.  Visitor: There were no faults showing when a diagnostic check was carried out at home this morning on behalf of me through my lender so this tells me Jeep have falsified their economy ststs. I need a lawyer then  Assistant: That is your right to do so.  Visitor: Please email me this transcript for my lawyer as Jeep are lying about the performance miles per gallon  Assistant: bear with me one moment please while I consult my resources  Assistant: thank you for your patience  Visitor: Please email me this nethomas@sky.com I have to leave for work, I run my own business  Assistant: I need to get in touch with another department regarding the chat transcript request and as soon as I have a response, I will send an email with further information.  Assistant: is there anything else I can help with?  Visitor: No, I am going to take Jeep to court for false statements"

Visitor: Sure I?m Kelvin Garrard  Visitor: It?s a Jeep Compass Assistant  Assistant: When and where did you purchase the vehicle from?  Visitor: I brought it from Thurlow Nunn which is actually a Vauxhall garage in April 2020  Visitor: From Dereham in Norfolk  Assistant: Has the concern been diagnosed in an Authorised Jeep retailer?  Visitor: Yes done by Desira in Norwich  Assistant: Okay, you will need to speak to customer care Jeep to raise a customer care case to wee if we can do anyhting to assist, you can either call customer care Jeep on 00800 0426 5337 option 2  Assistant: or email:  Visitor: I renew my car every 3-4 years and this Jeep is my favourite car I?ve had but it?s costing me so much in repairs for a car of not much age it?s put me off as my next car I was thinking of a Jeep  Assistant: customercare.uk@fcagroup.com  Assistant: If you contact us via email, please ensure that you confirm your vehicle details, your contact details and the name of the retailer that the vehicle has been diagnosed by  Assistant: Is there anyhting else that I can help you with?

Sales Contract Terms & Conditions;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: order number 8208 38656 - need best info on delivery date as without transport - can't plan ahead without knowledge of delivery date roughly? Help  Assistant: Good afternoon  Assistant: Is this a Assistantorder?  Visitor: Arnold Clark Linwood order  Assistant: Ok, Can I please take your full name and the vehicle registration plate that the order is linked too?  Visitor: thanks. My name is Sheila Adamson - this is a brand new car and I don't have the registration number, just the order number  Assistant: I see, what vehicle is it that you have ordered and what sort of timescale has the retailer given you for delivery?  Visitor: Jeep Renegade Night Hawk February 10th 2022  Assistant: Okay as the due date is a month in advance we will not be in a position to confirm the exact time and date this will be delivered to the retailer  Assistant: What I would reuest that at the beginning of Feb if you email customer care on customercareinternational@fcagroup.com  Assistant: we can then reach out to vehicle supply for further information  Assistant: Or you can call Jeep customer care on 00800 0426 5337 option 2  Visitor: that leaves me not knowing whether to buy a cheap runaround or pay for a hire car - I understood you can't be precise but you do know how long it takes to build a car which was ordered on December 13th and I took a red one as this had already been started so should be faster. I know you are trying to help me but I am no better off  Assistant: For vehicle delivery we can only really follow up on orders when they are late beyond the due date, the retailer that you have ordered the vehicle from speak to the same vehicle supply department that we at customer care will speak too for information  Assistant: It will not be possible to give you any more information that hasn't already been provided by Arnold Clark Linwood  Visitor: so, it is Jeep who aren't communicating - not good especially in these times where microchip shortages mean delays - Arnold Clark Linwood have been very good but they can't help me either.  Assistant: I don't understand, you have ordered a vehicle in December that is scheduled to be built in factory and the retailer have informed you that the scheduled delivery date for this vehicle is February 10th?  Visitor: You know swell as I do that delays are happening, some of them really bad. Jeep must know the impact this is having on their delivery processes - so why can't I find this out? If the answer is, none - great, tell me so. I will incur extra costs by limiting a car hire to a month/5 weeks - if I need to for longer - I am out of pocket. I need someone to give me their best informed estimate and I think that is reasonable  Assistant: I understand, if there is any delay with regards to vehicles that retailers have ordered, then this will be communicated directly to the retailer that has ordered the vehicle to keep their customer up to date with timescales  Assistant: Since you have ordered the vehicle has the retailer contacted you to say that the delivery date has been pushed back or have they confirmed tht the timescale is still the same?  Visitor: they are saying the order is in process and they don't know if it will be ready by Feb 10th - they have no other information  Assistant: Okay, I will raise a customer care case to follow up on the order to confirm what exactly has been informed to the retailer  Assistant: could you please confirm your mobile telephone number and email address please  Visitor: I am not questioning what Arnold Clark is telling me - I want jeep to indicate best estimate of actual delivery of this car. Please do not suggest that I am complaining about AC - I am not. So opening a case to check what Jeep have told them is pointless.My mobile no is 07753 233 969 sheilaadamson8@icloud.com  Assistant: Many thanks  Visitor: and to you  Assistant: I am currently in the process of opening a customer care case  Assistant: one moment and I will confirm your case reference number  Visitor: can I have a copy of the transcript of this chat please?  Assistant: When the CHAT is over, the option for the transcript will be made available to you  Visitor: thanks  Assistant: Thank you for your patience, the customer care case reference number is 01141499  Assistant: Once the case is assigned to a case manager, they will be in contact with you directly once we have obtained the feedback from our vehicle supply team  Assistant: Is there anything else that I can help you with?

-;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I bought a used Renegade from Jeep Slough on Friday 23rd September, I have only driven it on three occasions over the last 5 days and yesterday it broke down. Luckily I was close to home as it went into limp mode. It was collected by Jeep Shrewsbury this morning who asked for me to accompany the vehicle to the dealership. I was therefore surprised when they questioned whether it has warranty (Jeep Slough say it has the remainder of a 5 year warranty). I was further surprised when they didn`t have a courtesy vehicle available, I have since been offered a Transit van! and an electric car that I have no way of charging. I had to make my own way back home some 15 miles. I am now waiting to be collected once more to collect a Ford Fiesta. I am told my car may take 6 days to repair. This is not the service I expect from a premium brand and I am considering rejecting the car under the trade descriptions act. Can you please intervene to improve the service as I would prefer not to take this action if possible.

Visitor: I was told by a Jeep main agent to go there  Visitor: they didn't even offer me to get in touch with you, it was only when I queried what my options were after they rejected the claim that I was told to get in touch with you  Assistant: You said that the vehicle was inspected on 11 December and the warranty claimed was rejected by Jeep on the same day  Assistant: You could have contacted us the moment you were informed that the claim was rejected  Assistant: And we would have escalated the case right away  Visitor: yes because I have all the time in the world to do that  Visitor: like I said the car was first with the dealer on the 9th November, can you tell me if they've even submitted the claim or are they not being truthful with me?  Assistant: I know this is a difficult situation to be in and we are going to re-evaluate your case however we need your cooperation as well  Visitor: I've spoken to the bodyshop I am taking the car there now - he's advised that he will be closed from tomorrow at 3pm until the new year so you need to make sure you contact him tomorrow otherwise I will be without a car until the new year which is not at all acceptable nor is it reasonable for you to expect that  Visitor: my co-operation? All I've done is waste my time, how about some co-operation from you? Again the bodyshop have confirmed it is a common issue and he is surprised I am being messed around like this  Assistant: I dont think a case manager will get in touch with the tomorrow so dont send the vehicle there as you might be left without a car considering the body shop will be closed until new year.  Assistant: Im going to escalate your case at this moment and as soon as a case manager is assigned, they will get in touch with to discuss this matter  Assistant: given the exceptional circumstances  Visitor: and when do you expect they are likely to cont  Visitor: contact me*  Assistant: I cannot give you a timescale as I dont want to set false expectations  Assistant: Most likely they are going to contact you by Monday next week  Assistant: I will give you a case reference  Assistant: Bear with me one moment please  Assistant: thank you for your patience  Assistant: your case number is 01482257  Assistant: A case manager will get in touch with you as soon as possible  Assistant: is there anything else I can help with?

-;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hello I have a case registered with customer service but they just called me about it and it got cut off due to poor signal. I cannot contact them directly as the number provided takes you to a call centre where they then take your details and ask the case manager to call you back. Pointless. How can I get in touch with my case manager directly? Also why can?t they just email me?  Assistant: Do you have your vehicle details, or the case reference, please?  Assistant: I can ask the case manager to email you back, but I would like to confirm that they have your email address on file  Visitor: Case reference 01135880  Visitor: However there is now an update to the case which is even worse than the original complaint. I got the car back from the garage last Wednesday. Today I have tried to drive to work and the gearbox has completely gone. Fortunately just before I joined a motorway with my toddler son in the back.  Assistant: I have found the case  Assistant: can you kindly let me know which email address you would like to be contacted on?  Visitor: michelleknewman@hotmail.com  Assistant: I see a new email came in, I will notify your manager about it as well as attaching a transcript of this chat  Visitor: Thank you  Assistant: have you contacted the retailer about the issue with the gearbox? Or contacted roadside assistance?  Visitor: Not yet as I do not trust them and wanted to know what I could request from them. I want a courtesy car but was not offered one when it was taken in recently.  Visitor: But I assume it is the same issue they have supposedly just fixed as it is gearbox related again.  Visitor: I will contact them ASAP but I need them to collect the car from me as I have no way of getting it to them. Do I get some sort of roadside assistance automatically because it?s still under warranty?  Assistant: Yes, since your vehicle is under warranty, it has 3 years of roadside assistance  Assistant: the number is 0080004265337, option 1  Assistant: thye will collect your vehicle and if it's outside of retailer working hours, they can also supply a courtesy vehicle (which will otherwise be the retailer's responsibility to supply after they have done the diagnostic)  Visitor: Ok so I can call them and get them to take it to the garage?  Assistant: Yes, you can  Visitor: Ok thanks I will do that.  Assistant: In the meantime, do you know your vehicle's current mileage? I will update the case  Visitor: I don?t know it.  Assistant: That is fine, we can ask the retailer about it if necessary  Assistant: Can I help you with anything else?  Visitor: No that?s fine thanks. I can expect someone to contact me about the case?  Assistant: Yes, I will notify your case manager, but I do not know when she will call you back  Assistant: I cannot promise a timeframe  Visitor: Ok  Visitor: It is 5688 miles. Just checked  Assistant: Thank you  Assistant: Thank you for contacting Jeep today, for any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us again.

VIN check & Contents;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I've had a w58 recall done on my jeep grand cherokee. Could you explain why it's just a software update and not a full part replacement of the tone ring?  Assistant: The solution found by our technical department was a software update, so it was released as a recall campaign  Assistant: do you have the VIN? I can double-check the data on the completion for your vehicle  Visitor: VN15YOW  Visitor: Sorry I don't have the vin  Visitor: But the problem will still arise at some point when the part will fail and it will cost between £1300 and £1800 to replace a £65 part  Assistant: The VIN is on the database, linked to this registration, I can confirm the W58 campaign was completed for this vehicle in September and there are no outstanding campaigns  Visitor: What I'm not satisfied with the recall? Who do I escalate to?  Assistant: Our technical team believes the work included on the recall was an effective solution for this issue which had been reported  Assistant: We do not have an escalation  Assistant: If an issue comes up with the vehicle we are happy to look into it, but the software update released as part of W58 addresses the issue  Visitor: It stops the car from stalling at potentially high speeds and therefore saves the lives of the driver and passengers - so thanks for that. But what about the actual issue of the faulty part? Do I pay for that or are jeep happy to pay the invoice for the work?  Assistant: Has a retailer identified a faulty component on your vehicle, and confirmed it requires a replacement? If they do, and if they believe it is linked to a recall campaign or not addressed by a recall campaign, they can open a technical ticket for support  Assistant: the technical team can then evaluate the request  Assistant: please bear in mind that on a vehicle from 2015, only the operations included on a recall campaign are carried out free of charge, as the warranty has expired 3 years after vehicle registration  Visitor: Jeep, FCA, Stellantis have identified the fault in around 57000 vehicles i believe. So its not a case of if it will happen its 'when'. So there's nowhere for me to go with this?  Assistant: No sir, I'm afraid there is not, the issue was identified as well as a solution which involved a software update instead of a part replacement  Assistant: we do not expect further issues to arise from that system after the update  Visitor: So you can guarantee the car won't fail due to the tone ring?  Assistant: I cannot offer a guarantee that there won't be a failure  Assistant: but I can confirm that we believe the software update is an effective solution  Assistant: would you mind leaving your contact details, to register this chat today?  Visitor: Us Jeep GC WK2 owners won't leave this...

I did a 4hr motorway journey on 31st Oct and on the way home the battery was at 70%. It was booked into the garage for a service light warning and knocking under right offside wheel arch the following day so I told them about it. They charged the battery up and said all ok. On 2nd Nov the battery was back to 76% and the service light was still showing so it went back to the garage again. Yesterday they fitted a new battery and ordered a part for the service light warning. Overnight the battery has again dropped to 85%. The car is still at the garage now, they say the battery is just fine and that they can loose power  Assistant: When was your vehicle last diagnosed?

Visitor: I?ve been told to drive it again and see how it is overnight. I know that from the last 3 days it will drain again. I will collect it shortly and ask them fir the diagnostic. Anyone in particular it needs emailing to  Assistant: You can just contact our customer care team for further assitance  Assistant: assistance*  Visitor: Do I ask them to give me the diagnosis report or send it direct to yourselves?  Visitor: Is there a reference number I need to quote? Thank you for being helpful  Assistant: You just need to provide us with your name and registration number  Visitor: Thank you again, I really appreciate it.

Assistant: Yes, since they are the ones repairing your vehicle, they are best equipped to tell you what they are doing and when they expect your Jeep to be ready  Assistant: John is following the case but the retailer has first-hand knowledge of their own work on your Jeep  Visitor: ok thanks  Visitor: how long is my car warranty periiod?  Assistant: please bear with me a little longer, I am accessing the warranty database  Assistant: the warranty on your Jeep is valid until the midnight of 23/09/2024  Visitor: so three years ?

Assistant: Unless your vehicle is under a service plan, yes  Assistant: your vehicle has an active service plan, as part of the Jeep Wave program for owners of our newest vehicles  Assistant: so until 23/09/2024 or 27000 miles, you do not need to pay for servicing in our network  Assistant: when you make an appointment with a retailer, just remind them that the vehicle has this program active (they can see it on our warranty management database anyway)  Visitor: oh  Visitor: Glyn Hopkins advertised their service plan and I have purchased it  Visitor: :(  Assistant: I would recommend speaking to them about this, in that case  Assistant: maybe they can refund you the plan you have purchased  Assistant: or postpone its starting until the complimentary Jeep Wave easy care contract expires  Visitor: it makes sense thanks  Visitor: you are very helpful  Visitor: thanks a lor  Assistant: you are welcome  Assistant: Can I help you with anything else?
