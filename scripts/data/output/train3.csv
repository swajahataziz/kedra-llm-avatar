-;Visitor: We recently got a new battery fitted in our jeep renegade, this has resulted in the heating system not working. We had this changed at our local garage who informed us that it needs a system update in order for it to be fixed. This couldn't be done as it was Christmas so waited until 3rd of January, when they further found this needed to be done through jeep. Today I have spoke to 3 different jeep garages, one of which was over an hours drive away, none can help for at least 2 weeks. Without heaters the car is dangerous to drive as it is hard to see out and if it gets any colder will result in a frozen windscreen. One garage has also informed me that I will need to pay for this to happen, I don't understand why. The system was working fine until the battery was replaced, and I have a service bulletin explaining that this is a fault with Jeep, so I don't see that this charge should fall back on me. I have a 2 year old and work as a nanny so have not only mine but other people children in me car. This could potentially put me out of work, obviously resulting in a loss of earnings.  Assistant: Im sorry to learn that  Assistant: may I have the registration number of your vehicle?  Assistant: if you dont respond, this interaction will end automatically  Visitor: Mc16 nko  Assistant: thank you  Assistant: in the meantime, may I also have your full name, email and phone number to log this interaction?  Visitor: Harriet hite  Visitor: Harrietjones88@gmail.com  Visitor: 07941312246  Assistant: thank you for the details  Assistant: I would suggest you book your vehicle in at one of our authorised workshops for diagnostics  Visitor: They don't have any space for 2 weeks. What do I do until then? Drive a dangerous car with children in it  Assistant: If the ones you spoke to dont have any availability, I suggest you contact other retailers until you find one that can look at your vehicle sooner  Visitor: So you expect me to travel for over an hour  Assistant: We expect you to tow the vehicle to the garage considering its unsafe to drive it  Assistant: But that is up to you of course  Visitor: And this is all at my expense I take it  Assistant: Your vehicle is out of its warranty therefore the service would not be covered by Jeep  Visitor: The heating worked before something simple, changing the battery, caused it to stop. I have a service bulletin from jeep explaining this.  Assistant: This needs to be determined at an authorised workshop  Visitor: So for two weeks, I have no car as it is dangerous to drive, I may have to hire a car, get the jeep towed to a garage in 2 weeks, to spend money having diagnostics done to fix a fault that you are fully aware of.... So all in all probably going to cost over 500 to have this fixed. A fault that you are aware happens.  Assistant: Please find an authorised workshop that can inspect your vehicle and then you can contact us again, once it is diagnosed, for further assistance  Assistant: Is there anything else I can help with?  Visitor: This hasn't been helpful. It's been frustrating. I have also sent a formal complaint.

I?m not bothered about when it?s fixed but I need to get things moving. Everywhere seems to only be taking bookings six weeks away and one place said they don?t have a big enough car park to keep it that long. I need somewhere that doesn?t mind it being parked at their garage until it can be repaired as I won?t be here to take it to the garage any other time. Can you possibly help?

Visitor: Dear Jeep Uk I purchased a 2019 jeep compass from yourselves in Nov 2020 car reg DSZ 4363. I have taken care of the car, got it fully serviced, tyres etc , but on Saturday a funny noise started from the engine. The first day I could get a garage appointment was yesterday and I was thinking it could be a fan belt, or water pump etc. To my horror I was informed it is the turbo charger and the cost would be £3600. I cannot believe a car with 40k mileage has a blown turbo charger as they should last 100k to 150k. I have not slept since i found out as I have never been fined for speeding, I service the car, I am 53 and the car is used as a family car as well and taking me to work and back.I can work at home for a couple of weeks but will be needed to go back and visit people soon as I work in housing and have to visit people who have housing issues. We dont go on holidays, we dont live extravigant, we have 2 boys uner 13 and not only do I not have £3600, I dont have £1000 Our parents have passed so we cant borrow anything and I dont know what to do. Is there anything Jeep uk can do to help me please, as it is only 3 years old I still have 2 years to pay for it and I am a nerbous wreck can you please help as a gesture of goodwill as the warranty only ended a couple of months ago.This must have been fitted with a faulty turbo charger Kindest Regards Edward Cave 6 Underhill close Southport PR8 3FD 07802782370  Assistant: I will have to raise a case on regards to this issue,  Assistant: Are you the registered keeper of this car?

If the engine fails to start, the ignition should be returned to the STOP/OFF position prior to repeating the starting procedure.  mark: I thought it did but it?s not working the engine does not shut off. I thought I?d check before contacting the dealer I purchased it from. Is there a common reason for this  Assistant: I understand. In this case we recommend to contact an authorized retailer. I must say that this vehicle did not brought up all the details as it seems to be an US production. So a retailer can confirm and help sort out the issue.

-;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I am trying to get my SATNAV updated. Your system tells me that an update is available and it must be installed by a Dealer. The dealers that I have contacted say that the system does not recognise them.  Assistant: May I have the original registration plate number or the VIN number of the vehicle, please?  Visitor: 1C4RJFKM4FC891361  Assistant: May I please have the name of the registered owner?  Visitor: Peter Mills  Assistant: Are you the owner of the vehicle?

Assistant: May I please have your postcode to check?  Visitor: YES, Donald Mackenzie in Inverness and Arnold Clark in Perth . my post code IV36 2TG  Assistant: I need a moment to check, please  Assistant: one more moment, please. Thank you for your patience  Assistant: Thank you for waiting  Assistant: I have checked in the system and it seems only the dealer can help you. With the postcode you provided me, I checked for the nearest dealers and within 100km radius there is only 1 dealer and it is Donald Mackenzie. If you cannot take the vehicle to another dealer, then I would advise you to double check with this dealer again, as it is the only way  Visitor: I have spoken to the dealer already, when I received the same advice from you in December prior to getting lost in Geneva. I understand that this service is supplied by a third party. I wish you to find a dealer who can and will provide the necessary update. If two authorised dealers are not able to communicate with the update provider something is clearly wrong which only you can resolve.  Assistant: We cannot intervene with the schedule of the dealers and we cannot call them to ask which one can or cannot do the update. The customer has to call the dealers and to book appointments. However, if you would like to, we can open a case as a complaint against the dealer for the rude treatment  Visitor: The dealer is not rude . I am very happy with the performance of Donald Mackezie. They have explained that every time they try to do updates the system does not recognise their VAT number.  Assistant: We as customer services cannot do anything from our system. We can try to forward a case to the relevant department regarding the issue as the dealer is not doing the update. If t authorized dealers have such problems, they can also contact us via their own system. Their manager can do that if they are having problems with the update  Visitor: They have tried and Assistant.  Assistant: We can only open a case for a complaint against the dealer so a case manager can check what the issue might be that they are not able to assist you. Would you like me to do that?  Visitor: If that's the only way. Yes please.  Assistant: Alright, give me one moment to open the complaint case and I will give you the reference number also  Assistant: Mr. Mills, when did you take the vehicle to the dealer for the satnav?  Assistant: I assume the vehicle is with you right now, isn't it?  Visitor: I have the vehicle here now. I asked them to do the satnav when it was serviced in December  Assistant: During these past few months you have not contacted them again?  Visitor: Yes. I told them that you had previously told them to raise a case. I was there yesterday on a different issue and asked again about the satnav. Note that Arnold Clark in Perth expressed similar problems when I asked them to do it in December ( 1h 3m 52s ) Assistant: I have raised a case from customer services with the case no. 01573412. I have forwarded the case to the relevant department and a case manager will be assigned to your case as soon as possible and they will contact you to ask for more details. They will contact the dealer for more information and will follow up with you. If you have not received any call from us by the end of this week, you can give customer services a call and if they see a manager has already been assigned to your case and in that moment they are available, we will transfer the call to them ( 1h 4m 2s ) Assistant: Is there anything else I can help with? ( 1h 4m 58s ) Visitor: I hope that all this ends in a result! ( 1h 6m 6s ) Assistant: We will look into this and will contact you to follow up, although I cannot guarantee a positive result, as it is another department who looks into this issue ( 1h 6m 19s ) Assistant: Is there anything else I can help you with at the moment?

Visitor: Hi we have have a Jeep Compassn2021 it has less than £11000 on the clock and twice now in the past two weeks it has broken down. This is not what I expected from a car that is almost new, and I certainly feel I shouldn't have to worry about driving the car in fear that I'm going to get stranded again. We can't get into our nearest Fiat dealer until April 4th and this was booked after the first breakdown because they don't have a courtesy car available and we only have one car. They suggested you might sort it out and provide a courtesy car seeing as ours is under warranty so we can get it to the garage and get it fixed.  Assistant: We are very sorry to hear that you are experiencing issues with your Compass,  Assistant: I can provide you with the contact information of the Roadside Assistance, and they can tow your Jeep to the nearest retailer, and also provide a courtesy car for you  Assistant: Telephone number: 00800 0426 5337 choosing option number 1  Visitor: Hi thank you for getting back to me. We have called the assistance and the garage has told us we can get it towed to them but the breakdown has said they won't do it if they can get it started.  Assistant: Can I ask if your vehicle is drivable?  Assistant: You can reach the RSA for the courtesy car too  Visitor: No this is the second time it wont start the ignition is on and won't switch off, so I have a car that has power but does not turn over. The battery then goes flat. The breakdown last time charged the battery and said take it to the garage. We've driven it since then but again it's done the same thing. It' sitting with power but will not switch off or start.  Assistant: Did you send it to the garage as the roadside advised?  Assistant: Yes, since you vehicle would not start, please reach the roadside assistance, and ask them to send somebody to tow your car to the retailer  Visitor: The garage won't see us until the 4th April so the problem will keep happening until we can get it to the garage.  Assistant: And from the moment that your car will be booked on-site, please reach out to us so we can follow up with the repairs needed together with the retailer  Assistant: And please can you provide me with your name, email address, telephone number and registration plate, in order for me to log this chat  Visitor: Yes it's Andrew Harrison, 07415371658 email andy@harrisondigitalmedia.co.uk Car RegistrationAssistant  Visitor: Do we ask the assistance to take it direct to the garage, as they insist on starting it and it breaks down again.

;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hi. I am on a 3 year lease for my Jeep with your service plan. Check engine flashes up intermittently with VERY sluggish, juddery engine. Had to wait 1.month to get it serviced. On booking the service I advised them of the issue. Attended the service and told no time to check the problem and to rebook another appointment which would need to be overnight so in need of a loan car. Told have to wait another month for this appointment. This wil leave me 2 months on the road with an unreliable vehicle which could have an engine fail at any time. Obviously this is not acceptable  Assistant: In order for us to further assist can you please provide us with your name, email address, and your vehicle's registration plate,  Visitor: Natasha Zinman  Visitor: natasha@monkeyingabout.co  Visitor: Com  Visitor: Assistant  Assistant: Thank you, so your vehicle would be an Renegade 2020?  Visitor: Yes  Assistant: I can confirm that your car is still under the warranty, I kindly suggest you to reach the roadside assistance, they can either send a technician and perform a diagnosis, or provide you with the pick-up service or towing service, and also with a courtesy car  Visitor: The car does not need road side assist now. It drives. The warning is currently gone. As advised the fault appears and disappears.. My issue is the length of time to get the fault FIXED.  Assistant: I understand, please be informed that we cannot interfere on our retailers schedule or agenda,  Assistant: I can provide you with some other retailers in your area, maybe they can book the car sooner  Visitor: They all have the same problem with the timetable as you have had several dealers close in the wider area which has forced an unreasonable, unmanageable demand on the remaining dealers. The problem therefore lies with Jeep's network.  Assistant: I totally understand your concern, and this is something we are working on with, however, we are unable to interfere with booking the appointments  Assistant: It should be done only by the registered keeper  Visitor: The problem is not my fault - it's a Jeep network issue and I should not be expected to drive an unreliable car for 2 months because of a Jeep network issue. It is not a safe situation and it is impossible for me to resolve in a reasonable timeframe due to Jeep's network issue.  Assistant: That is why we are suggesting you to reach roadside assistance, so they can send a technician to check the vehicle,  Visitor: The road side assistance guys cannot repair the problem.  Assistant: And the booking is not an issue, the retailers have their agenda with the appointments, they are accepting cars,  Visitor: I do not understand your comment above. Are you saying the dealer could book me in and are just choosing not to?  Assistant: I am saying that our retailers have to respect their agenda, they can book your car, when they will have the free schedule  Visitor: Of course this is the case. This is what I am complaining about. Jeep's network is now too small to meet the needs of its customers and it is causing me to have to drive an unreliable car with kids for 2 months  Assistant: We totally understand your point of view and we would like to inform you that we will take advantage of your suggestions, which are very important to us as a further motivation to continue with passion and professionalism in the development of our services and products  Visitor: That does not help me or fix my situation  Assistant: I promptly forwarded your report to our relevant department so that, where possible, they take due account of it  Visitor: If your network cannot resolve a check engine issue sooner than 2 months, then I would like to end my lease early. It is currently due to end in September.  Assistant: As you were informed previously I can provide you with the contact information of some other retailers in your area,  Assistant: Please provide us with the one you have been in contact with  Assistant: And we will check for other retailers  Visitor: I have tried them. I do not have a problem getting dealer contact details.  Assistant: Please be informed that we cannot interfere on their scheduled appointments,  Visitor: From memory I have tried Epsom and Walton Upon Thames. I am not prepared to drive over an hour  Assistant: You will have to book your appointment and then reach us the customer care so we can follow up with the repairs with the retailer  Assistant: Okay, so from the moment the warning appears again, you can reach the roadside assistance  Assistant: They can perform the diagnostics as well  Visitor: You are missing the point. I do not want to drive around in a car for another month waiting to need road side assistance with kids in the car potentially far from home!  Assistant: Yes, that is why I suggested you to reach them right now, so they can check the car and make sure it is safe to drive  Visitor: I have just had it serviced with your dealer 2 days ago. I told you this in the first message  Visitor: They have confirmed I can drive it but that it could fail at any time  Visitor: If there is no other solution, I would like to look at ending the lease earlier.  Assistant: I have already provided you with the possible solutions, the best one is to check for another retailer, maybe they can book the car earlier  Visitor: I have told you I tried this already  Visitor: If there is no other solution, I would like to look at ending the lease earlier.  Assistant: Then please reach the roadside so they can perform the diagnostics check  Visitor: We are going in a circle. I have told you the car was serviced 2 days ago. It needs a repair. Road side assistance do not repair  Assistant: I do apologize, but these are the possible solutions, I am willing to assist you with all the information we have  Assistant: The rsa can tow your car to the retailer and provide you with a courtesy car  Visitor: I do not want a courtesy car for a month. This is not what I am paying for.  Visitor: I do not currently need road side assistance as the car drives right now.. I therefore an forced to keep driving until it fails again  Visitor: Who do I need the speak to about ending the lease early as it seems the above are the only solutions you have available to you.  Assistant: I believe with the company you have signed the leases  Assistant: I can provide you with our finance department contact information  Assistant: If you have the finance with us  Visitor: It is a lease via leasys  Visitor: The end without penalty, I would need to go through Jeep though  Assistant: Finance department. Please find their contact details below: Telephone: 0344 561 4738 Website: http://www.jeep.co.uk/uk/financial-services e-mail: customer-relations@fcagroup.com Address: FCA Automotive Services Ltd PO Box 4465 Slough Berkshire SL1 0RW  Visitor: Thank you  Assistant: You are more than weclcome!

Some time ago I found out that there is a revocable company for my car to replace the catalytic converter. The official representative office in my country (Ukraine) tells me that they cannot replace the catalyst, since it is not available. It doesn't even give any deadlines. They say that the plant does not supply these spare parts. I understand how a badly worn catalytic converter affects emissions and would like to have it replaced by a recall company as soon as possible. Maybe somehow you can send a catalyst specifically for my car to the official service? Help solve this problem. Thank you. P.S. I have already addressed in writing with this problem on the site https://www.jeep.com/. They assigned the number 85992187 to my complaint. And they told me to contact you with my problem.  Visitor: Sorry for my English.  Assistant: The vehicle is registered in UK or in Ukraine? In the customer care system it does not shows as UK  Visitor: The vehicle is registered in Ukraine  Visitor: I don't know who else to turn to for help  Visitor: The official representative in my country cannot help me with this problem  Assistant: You have contacted the UK customer care. We here don't know what the procedure of Jeep for Ukraine is, as we are trained only for the UK market. I will raise a case and see if I can transfer it to the Ukrainian market. I don't know if they have your email for the complaint or not as I don't see anything with your VIN. Have you already placed an order for the part with a dealer or you are looking to do that?  Assistant: May I please have your email address and a phone number?  Visitor: My dealer says there are no parts and that the manufacturer does not supply them. They said to call once a month and find out.

I would now like to escalate this further to someone who will have the curtesy to respond appropriately  Visitor: Please will you let me know what will happen now  Assistant: My colleague has invited you to send vehicle to an authorised dealer to have it diagnosed  Assistant: Without a diagnosis report, we are unable to escalate I am afraid  Visitor: That?s not addressing the complaint  Visitor: I am also complaining about your retailers who operate to yours standards  Assistant: Which dealership are you complaining about?  Assistant: Are you referring to Motorvogue Bedford?  Visitor: It?s all detailed out in my email, along with copy of communications.  Assistant: If so, Motorvogue Bedford are not part of our authorised network so we are unable to communicate with them any longer  Visitor: The response does not acknowledge anything I have said.  Visitor: Yes they are. It shows they are on your website  Assistant: Apologies, I meant Glyn Hopkin Leyton  Assistant: We are unable to communicate with Glyn Hopkin Leyton  Visitor: Glyn Hopkin are, the particular branch is no longer providing Jeep services as of late  Visitor: MotorVogue continue to be in your authorised network  Assistant: If you want the issues your vehicle is presenting addressed, vehicle needs to be sent to an authorised retailer for diagnostics  Visitor: Will you be escalating my complaint with MotorVogue.  Assistant: You have mentioned that the last time you contacted Motovogue was in August 2022  Visitor: According to the Consumer Rights Act 2015, MotorVogue Bedford are responsible. As your authorised retailer operating to your terms will you assist me in my complaint  Assistant: We are unable to follow up a matter with the retailer that took place a year ago  Visitor: Why  Visitor: Do my consumer rights go out the window?  Visitor: From a legal perspective  Assistant: Because the time in which issues are reported to us is important too  Visitor: I reported them on August 02  Visitor: After the retailer washed their hands of it  Assistant: You didnt contact customer care in 2022  Visitor: I have attached full comms with the retailer  Visitor: Yes I did  Assistant: You are contacting us almost a year after the events took place  Visitor: On 02 Aug  Visitor: I contacted Jeep  Assistant: We do not have any records of that happening on our end  Visitor: I would like to escalate this further  Assistant: I am afraid we cannot escalate a case without a recent diagnosis report  Assistant: Is there anything else I can help with?  Visitor: If you?re unable to do so, I will be escalating to the Motor Ombudsman and seeking legal advice.  Assistant: I understand  Assistant: Is there anything else I can help with?  Visitor: Please may you give me a copy of all details related to this case  Visitor: Please may I have details to get in touch with your legal team to understand my legal rights. Your colleague told me the customer care team is not trained to give legal response such as what my consumer rights are  Visitor: Please can you point me to the particular clauses with respect to why escalating this case further at this time when the car was purchased in 2022 means you cannot support  Assistant: Bear with me one moment while I consult my resources  Visitor: No problem  Assistant: I have just created a Data Portability request  Assistant: You should receive an email with the Privacy request case number  Visitor: Yes, I have this  Assistant: That's great!  Assistant: You will be contacted by the relevant team as soon as your request is fulfilled  Visitor: What is a data portability request?  Assistant: It is a request for access to case details, case notes and transcripts  Visitor: And how long will this take  Assistant: I don't have this information I am afraid  Assistant: As soon as we have an update regarding your request, we will contact you  Visitor: And with respect to the reason of time being the particular reason why you will not address my concerns - have you managed to consult your resources in respect to where I can reference this and my legal rights  Assistant: Our procedure dictates that if a vehicle presents an anomaly, we require a recent diagnosis issued within the last 48 hours from an authorised retailer in order to escalate to 2nd level and offer further assistance  Assistant: Is there anything else I can help with?  Visitor: I was asking in respect to a complaint about MotorVogue as your authorised retailer  Visitor: The complaint is in regards to them  Visitor: How will this be addressed  Assistant: We are unable to follow up with the retailer on this matter as the condition of the car is not the same as in 2022 therefore the circumstances have changed  Visitor: So you do not hold any account for your authorised retailers and the manner in which they trade?  Visitor: There are no standards that you uphold them to?  Visitor: You have visibility of the communications from them and you can clearly see how they misrepresented the condition at point of sale as well as neglected support in my consumer rights according to UK law.  Visitor: This is all evidenced  Visitor: What does a retailer have to do in order to be authorised?  Assistant: I am adraid this is not related to the standard offered by retailer but rather the lapse between the occurrence of your issues and you reporting them to us  Visitor: How does the time impact my consumer rights?  Visitor: Or the manner in which the retailer acted at that time which you can see  Assistant: I suggest you discuss this with a legal representative as I am not trained for this matter  Assistant: Or you can contact Motor Ombudsman  Visitor: Yes, please will you escalate this to your legal team to get a response  Assistant: This is not possible I am afraid  Visitor: Why not  Assistant: Is there anything else I can help with?  Visitor: Why can this not be escalated to your legal team?  Visitor: Who can this case be escalated to?

Assistant: We have already provided our final response  Visitor: You have told me you don?t know when I will receive my case file  Visitor: So I request you respond back on the email  Visitor: As I was instructed by yourselves to do yesterday  Visitor: It does not say in the email this is the final response  Visitor: Nor does it say you will not speak to the retailer  Visitor: Nor does it reference the time period being an issue  Assistant: The email you received earlier is related to the Data Portability request and not to your issues with the vehicle  Visitor: Please may you give me a call. My number is 07732433093  Assistant: There is nothing else to discuss I am afraid  Visitor: I would like to open a new case  Assistant: In relation to what specifically?  Assistant: if you dont respond, this interaction will end automatically  Visitor: I would like to raise a complaint in respect to having been refused a response over email to a previous case. The reason being is that I do not have the information in one place  Assistant: We are going in circles here  Visitor: I have asked for an email  Assistant: My colleague and I have already responded to your queries  Assistant: If you dont find it acceptable  Assistant: please refer to Motor Ombudsman  Visitor: Which is your process not mine.

I?d like to raise a complaint case regarding SC86365? KRIS.  Visitor: please may you assist  Assistant: Hello how are you  Assistant: I am sorry mayI know your issue please?  Visitor: I?m a little disappointed at the customer care, but by no means does this reflect on you  Visitor: Absolutely, I will note this now  Assistant: I am very sorry my apologies  Visitor: I got in touch via chat to discuss an existing case. It appeared that the details I provided hadn?t been read based on the email response. I was put in touch with Assistantover this chat. KRIS provided a quite different response to the email. I asked KRIS as this was a long chat conversation if they would repeat what they have said to me in the email thread as it?s succinct and clear. KRIS refused this and said the words said over chat were final. Lots was said and I would appreciate this being written over email as I was asked to do so (which I did).  Visitor: Assistanthad quite an aggressive tone  Assistant: ?  Visitor: As such I would like to raise an additional complaint regarding the customer care from KRIS  Assistant: I am very sorry do you have any case number please?  Visitor: Yes, it is 01638203  Assistant: Thank you, bear with me please  Visitor: Not a problem, thank you  Assistant: Which is your request please? I will move your complaint to the relevant department for sure with priority  Visitor: What do you mean which is my request?  Assistant: Regarding the vehicle please  Visitor: I am not satisfied with the response I have received on 01638203. In particular is does not address my concerns in which your authorised retailer has operated. The email response seems like my concerns were not read through.  Visitor: inwould like to escalate this  Visitor: In addition I would like to raise a complaint in regards to the customer rep KRIS who said several different things over chat but refused to summarise them via mail. I?m not sure why.  Visitor: If you would prefer to have a conversation over the phone I am happy to do so  Assistant: I understand your frustration perfectly  Assistant: And I am sorry about that  Assistant: As I mentioned about my colleague I will raise the complaint and move your feedback to the relevant department  Visitor: Thank you, I appreciate it  Assistant: More than welcome please  Assistant: But our main issue would be for your vehicle right?  Visitor: In respect to my original case, would it be possible to speak with someone or have this further escalated. I am quite disappointed that the response neglects anything I have mentioned and is templated  Assistant: I understand  Visitor: My main issue is the retailer and how they have operated in order to fix the issues with the car. Under the consumer rights act 2015, they are responsible for a refund, repair or replacement. As they operate under the authorisation of Jeep (FCA) I am both complaining about them and subsequently resolving the matter  Visitor: As an authorised retailer of yourselves I understand that they operate to a level of standards set by yourselves. As such I am referring my complaint to you as the manufacturer with responsibility for your retailer  Assistant: I am checking the case with my colleague and you want to move the case further to the relevant department  Assistant: but following our policy we are unable to move the case further without having the vehicle there and diagnosed  Visitor: It?s A complaint about the retailer, not just the car  Assistant: I seen  Assistant: bear with me please just one moment  Visitor: You can see the communication of the retailer in the email and how they failed to make me aware of my consumer rights  Visitor: In the communications is photo and video evidence of the issues throughout and how they developed. Likewise, Glyn Hopkins will have a diagnostics report from when they took the car. I understand this is back in August. But does not make a difference to how MotorVogue behaved  Assistant: Glyn Hopkin Leyton this is the one that you will diagnose your vehicle?  Visitor: No, that branch no longer works with you.  Visitor: They did back in August  Visitor: They did it then  Assistant: Yes this is why I asked  Assistant: You want to raise a complain for Motorvouge?  Visitor: Yes, the complaint is first and foremost about MotorVogue and how they operated as your authorised retailer. It?s also (maybe a separate case for you) about how Glyn Hopkins handled from August onwards.  Visitor: I am complaining as it?s past a simple repair on warranty at this point  Assistant: I understand your main concern is the issue with our retailer, Assistant  Visitor: Yes  Visitor: This is why I provided the comms as you can see everything  Visitor: How does Jeep/FCA handle complaints about their authorised retailers?  Assistant: We collect information from our customers, and following what happened we move the case to the relevant department at our main offices.  Visitor: I have provided such information and the response I got does not reflect what you just said - what you said is what I wouid have thought  Assistant: I understand, bear with me just one moment please  Visitor: Thank you, no problem  Assistant: Before moving the case to our relevant department we would need a recent diagnose from our dealer or vehicle on site.  Assistant: So please in order for me or my colleagues to move the case further you would have to move the vehicle there and we immediately interfere  Visitor: What has a diagnosis got to do with my complaint about MotorVogue. There is a full history with evidence  Visitor: Please can I speak about this over the phone  Assistant: Bear with me just one moment please  Assistant: as I am checking  Visitor: Thank you.  Assistant: More than welcome  Assistant: May I know please some information from your behalf in order to move the case to the relevant department if possible? First what is the main issue with your vehicle what is the exact anomaly?  Visitor: Yes. It?s detailed with more specifics throughout the email chains. The main issue is with the electronics - it affects the MMU mostly, but has at times caused other issues including my car not turning on. Following diagnostics in August Glyn Hopkins concluded a full replacement was required. I also have concerns with the electric motor which has a times made bad noises. This too was included throughout the comms along with pictures and videos  Assistant: I see you have other issues too, please in order for us to move the case further we need a diagnose but a recent one not from August from one of our authorized retailers. At the moment that the vehicle will be at the dealer I move the case to our relevant department and my colleagues from our main offices will follow up with every request and issue that you have.  Assistant: But without moving the vehicle physically at the dealer,I am unable to move the case further.  Visitor: As I understand under my consumer rights I have the ability to exercise my rights for a full refund or replacement vehicle with the dealer (your authorised retailer).  Visitor: Hence why I am seeking support with a complaint against your authorised retailer. It?s not just about fixing the issue a year and a half later.  Assistant: Yes you are right but following my procedure here I cannot move the case further without a recent diagnose or having the vehicle at the dealer,after we will follow up with the complaint too  Visitor: Is the complaint is about the manner in which an authorised retailer conducted themselves but not the car, what is the procedure?  Visitor: if you agree I am right, and this does not fit the pre-defined procedures is it possible to escalate this appropriately to understand what the correct procedure would be as this clearly isn?t it  Visitor: And the retailer is the one who has the responsibility to address this - they can pick up the car from me. I am complaining to Jeep as the body setting the standards for them  Assistant: The procedure is that you have some anomalies in you vehicle and also a complaint for one of our retailers but in order for me or my colleagues to move this to the relevant department,we need the vehicle there.  Visitor: I cannot physically do that  Visitor: I can only have the car collected from me  Visitor: I have had surgery  Assistant: You can contact RSA and they can move the vehicle to the nearest authorized dealer.  Visitor: I have done that. They said Jeep or the dealer must call up, organise it and pay for it  Visitor: Nearest dealer is an hour away  Assistant: No we do not arrange collections for none of our customers.  Assistant: We can only transfer you to RSA and you communicate with them  Visitor: Hence, the complaint against the dealer. It?s their responsibility  Visitor: I am complaining about the dealer not the car first and foremost. The complaint to the dealer is the car  Assistant: Yes and in order for us a customer care to further help you we need the vehicle there at the dealership that you complain  Visitor: The procedure fits standard issues for warranty claims but does not relate to this which is a dealership conduct complaint  Assistant: Would you like me to give you a call?
