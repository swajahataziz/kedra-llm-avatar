Case: Call Reason Detail;Body
;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hello. I put my jeep into a garage ( not jeep) they had to replace a transmission box as mine had blown up and was unable to be reimbursed. I picked my car up today and there is a SVC 4x4 light on the dash board that says on, the garage where I had the repairs done bought the box from jeep Canterbury . The garage said they diagnostic machine can't read the codes or turn the light on to see why it is on, they believe it needs updating due to the new transmission box, and said I would have to get jeep to update/ turn of the dash light. I also had to have a new battery , even tho I had a battery fitted by jeep less then two years ago. I rang your canterbuy branch today and they said no one can confirm what that light is I would need to bring the car in to have a diagnostic test, they said that would cost £120. I have just spent £3550 on replacement of the transmission box and battery as your parts are ridiculously expensive and I can't find used parts as most of the modules were recalled. Can you please tell me why you have the machine and updates I need but need to charge me £120 Todo it when I'm told it would only take you 10 mins? Are you telling me every time I need to replace a part I need to take it to you. I have had many problems with this jeep it was bought not a jeep, but you are still the people that made this! My doors lock and will not unlock. I have to climb out the boot and disconnect the battery , I had to have a new Axel , I had to have a new transmission box and a new battery in less then 3 years of having this car  Visitor: Please can you tell me why there are so many issues and when they need fixing it's more expensive then any other car? How can you sell a car. (2014 plate) and it has all this issues at 96000 miles? I'm being told to have my light turned of or my system updated it is now going to cost me another £120 and then what will you charge to fix the issue? How do I know somthing else won't go wrong? It has never been ok? You made the car , that breaks and yet I have to pay so much money for you to tell me what it is, for you then to charge ridiculous prices to fix it and then ridiculous prices for the parts, it's nearly impossible to get second hand parts as the parts don't last. I'm stuck with this car for the next 4 years while I pay it off , it's costing me more money to own it then to pay for it.  Assistant: I am really sorry to read all this Danielle. However, with this type of request, regrettably we would not be in a position to assist through the chat facility.

;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: To who may concern / Customer Service I am extremely unhappy with the level of expertise and customer service I have received from Mangoletsi & Swansway Jeep in Cheshire and S.G, Petch in York UK . They have my vehicle taken in as a breakdown emergency & are not communicating - I am of the opinion they caused the damage and potentially a fire due to a reset done a week before the breakdown, I need your help to get answers please. the issue is ongoing for 4 years from 2018 my Grand Cherokee (VN63BHV) vehicles alarm kept going off randomly, 2018 The car was first taken to Swansway Jeep in Chester in the UK where I paid £130 to investigate, A conclusion was reached to reset the electrical system. this seemingly partially effective for about 6 months. In 2019 while working on contract in York in the UK the alarm randomly went off again, this cost me another £130.00 paid to S.G.Petch in York - they found nothing obvious and reset the electrical system once again, this again seemed to solve the issue for a little over a year. Early 2021 the alarm began going off randomly again - I once again took the vehicle to Swansway Jeep in Chester. another £130.00 to fault find the issue! Frustratingly they came to the conclusion was the vehicle needed a new battery, so this was replaced with firstly a generic battery that wasn't good enough I once again paid out more money to fit a Jeep battery costing around £400... Assistanta few days later the Jeep was back in at Swansway as the alarm issue continued, this time they said it was the hood switch that was faulty costing me a further £230.00 to replace the hood switch. September of this year the issue returned I called Swansway Jeep to investigate only to be informed they longer support or work on Jeep products. I arranged with the next closest Jeep service center which is Mangoletsi Jeep, this time I paid a further £130.00 to investigate they said it was the battery in the horn that was faulty ??? I had to take their word for this. The part was repaired on 8th November for £400+ - At this time Mangoletsi told me that was also an engine recall software upgrade they had to do - which they completed on the same day. I have been given no further information about this recall. I'm of the opinion that this reset has caused more underlying issues because on Saturday 13th November whilst out for the day the battery light came on and the vehicle very quickly lost power, on opening the hood there was a lot of smoke coming from the engine specifically near the alternator. I had the vehicle towed to Mangoletsi on the same day - I'm still waiting for information on what the fault is and am now getting the feeling like they are hiding due to damage they caused in the reset, I have called them 2 a day since Monday and am getting the run around from your approved service center. I have twice asked to speak to Workshop manager only to be told they are in meetings & will return a call, No one has called me as of Thursday afternoon, I'm having to hire taxi's and rely on friends for transport! I would like you to attend to this ongoing issue as a matter of urgency please and look forward to hearing how this will be resolved. regards Craig Adams

VIN check & Contents;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hi , can you please advise on my Jeep Grand Cherokee possible recalls  Visitor: Hi ana  Assistant: Can you kindly provide your vehicle's registration and chassis number?

Visitor: Was noted in Jeep club uk  Assistant: I have received some information about this, yes, but your vehicle is not included on that campaign (reference W58, I believe)  Visitor: Ok thanks , can you also check for an upgrade to software for gear change , there is a service bulletin to change oil to a diffirent spec and have transmission gear change updated  Assistant: I'm afraid that only Jeep retailers have access to the service bulletins  Assistant: they would apply the service bulletin if you contact them and they verify an issue with your vehicle  Assistant: do you mind leaving a name and email to register this enquiry today?  Visitor: Also , there are reports of premature engine failures due to big end shells wearing , are FCA covering any costs if this happens to my car or extended warranty etc  Assistant: there's no campaign for this on the vehicle, so we would not have a blanket solution. If there is an engine failure, we would need a retailer to complete a diagnostic to identify the cause, and then depending on this, we may ask them to submit a goodwill claim  Assistant: the warranty on the vehicle has expired 3 years after the date of first registration, so it can no longer be claimed  Assistant: are you experiencing any issues with your Grand Cherokee?  Visitor: Yes , had a couple of strange noises from bottom of engine  Assistant: the best advice I can give is to make a booking with a retailer to understand what is causing this noise, and address the issue as soon as possible. Please bear in mind that when the retailer completes the diagnostic, to submit a goodwill claim, they will need also the vehicle's service history  Assistant: are you the first owner? Does the vehicle have a full service history with Jeep retailers? This, as well as the current mileage, will also be a factor to consider  Visitor: Ok thanks , I will keep an eye on it , also one last question, how long is the body warranty as I seem to be getting some rain water on the inside of the passenger carpet when it rains , on the floor ?  Visitor: A leak on the body  Assistant: Depends on what is causing the water ingress - if there is perforating rust or not. The Perforation warranty is 7 years with no mileage limitation for all Jeep vehicles. If there is any other cause, like a panel who is not fitted just right of a gasket wearing out, the warranty was 3 years  Assistant: would you mind leaving a name and email to register this enquiry today?  Visitor: William findlay, email findlayw08@aol.com  Assistant: Can I help you with anything else?  Visitor: That?s fine thanks , have a good day ANA  Visitor: Bye  Assistant: Thank you for contacting Jeep today, for any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact us again.

Services are due every year, starting from the date of 1st registration, so if the car is an 18 plate, it should have had 2 services by now  Visitor: Its a private registration plate, the car was a July 2019 model, service was done Sept 2020.  Assistant: ah, ok, i saw the 18...  Visitor: Completely understand  Assistant: in this case, one service only was due  Assistant: but still, we cannot confirm 100% that this is not going to affect the warranty  Visitor: But by being late it in effect invalidated the warantee  Visitor: I read that there was a code that could be applied for to extend the gap due to covid. Is there a way of checking if this happened?  Assistant: flexibility was applied if the service was due during the lockdown period, officially from 23/03 to 20/06 - any exceptions to this would have been considered on a case to case basis,  Assistant: so I can really not comment on the validity of the warranty  Assistant: is it a private sale or are you buying it from a garage?  Visitor: Garage, but not a jeep franchise  Assistant: maybe you can come to an agreement with them  Visitor: Thanks for your help.  Assistant: you are welcome - is there anything else that i can help you with?

Maintenance Coverage & Prices;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I have been told by the dealer that sold me the car that jeep do a 3 year maintenance plan and would cost me £499. Can you tell me more as I am finding the website difficult to find out. Plus does this plan include all Labour, parts and fluids for each scheduled service  Assistant: Hi thank you for contacting us today  Assistant: just one moment  Assistant: Please be advised that this offer covers the cost of parts, lubricants and labour required as part of the manufacturer's scheduled servicing. However, items which require replacement or repair due to wear and tear or misuse are not covered under this offer.  Visitor: Ok. So as usual for a service. Is the plan transferable to another jeep if I changed vehicle and is there a monthly payment option or would I pay £499 up front to cover three years of services. Can you also confirm this is correct price please and can I wait and take it out nearer the time that first service is due?  Assistant: Would you be able toi provide me with your VIN please?  Visitor: where would that be. I just have the v5 slip....just found it! 1c4bu0001lp003269  Assistant: thank you just one moment  Assistant: yes you would be able to get the Easy care plan, this would be something you pay upfront but would not be transferable to another vehicle. It would be transferable to a new owner however.  Visitor: ok. So £499 for three services. Is that correct? Am I able To take it up before service is due. I.e. August this year. How do I go about purchasing and can I use any jeep garage for servicing with the plan?  Assistant: The easy Care plan ? Can be purchased within 12 months from the date of registration of the vehicle. ? The contract must be subscribed before the first maintenance servicing for your Vehicle. ? Max Eligibility Mileage is 10.000 miles  Assistant: also  Assistant: Easy Care is valid starting from the start date of the warranty, not from the date of stipulation of the Easy Care contract Easy Care is transferable to the new owner of the vehicle if the Customer sells it Easy Care may be carried out within the Service Network anywhere in the European Economic Area.  Visitor: That?s great. So can you confirm the price and do I buy from the dealer I purchased from or can I purchase direct from you before first service is due? If so how do I do so. Thank you  Visitor: that?s 10k per annum?  Assistant: The price I have has not been updated since november so it would be best to confirm with the retailer. You can buy the plan from any Jeep agent. The 10,000 is only the eligibility to buy the plan initially and does not affect the plan subsequently.  Visitor: And your statement that it is valid from start date of warranty...does that mean if I take out just before service is due...I.e. a year from first reg...the easy care plan would only have two more years to run? Would I get three services done if I took up or would it only cover two?  Assistant: The plan would cover for the first three services for the vehicle. so your first service would be due in September, and you would then have cover for the following two Septembers and get three services  Assistant: The plan would not start from when you buy the plan but to cover the recommended servicing schedule for the vehicle.  Visitor: But it would be three services? That?s great. You?ve been extremely helpful. Thank you.  Assistant: it would be three, ys. My pleasure, please let me know if you need anything else.  Visitor: no that?s fine. Thanks v much.  Assistant: ok thanks for contacting us today!  Visitor: &#128077;"

Visitor: Emma  Visitor: Hinton  Visitor: Emmabhinton@gmail.com  Assistant: OK Thank you. I can see that this vehicle has had only one campaign ascocisted with it and that was for Software updates. However those updates were carried out on the vehicle before it was originally sold and registered.  Assistant: *associated  Assistant: What kind of issue are you experiencing with the radio and have you had this presented to a Jeep service centre?  Visitor: It turns itself on and off  Visitor: Yes - that?s why I know it?s a fault  Assistant: Which retailer has seen the vehicle?  Visitor: It has not been taken in  Visitor: The details have been shared on the phone  Visitor: And they said it was a fault with jeep radios  Assistant: OK, but would you be able to tell me who you have spoken with?  Visitor: Jeep in Perth  Assistant: OK thank you. As we do not have a recall that relates to the concern you have reported it would be difficult for us to comment further unless the vehicle is physically inspected. However this would be at you charge.  Visitor: How much?  Assistant: You would need to discuss that with the retailer as they would determine their labour charge. However as there is no recall and the vehicle is no longer in warranty you would need to authorise the inspection and repair.  Visitor: So jeep radios break after 6 years  Visitor: Your service dept has already said there are faults  Visitor: I had a 15 year old Toyota that didn?t have this problem  Assistant: I can only suggest to have the radio inspected and discuss the repair with the retailer, as the vehicle is no longer covered by warranty you will need to authorise the cost of the repair.  Visitor: I haven?t broke it  Visitor: It?s not reasonable that thud has happened  Assistant: I didnt suggest you had, however the warranty provided for the vehicle has expired. over 2 years ago.  Visitor: So radios should only last 4 years?

Visitor: You didn?t answer my question  Visitor: A £8000 car should have a radio that works  Visitor: I will call in the morning  Visitor: This is a very disappointing response  Visitor: Hopefully you don?t have a jeep  Assistant: Well we provide a 3 year guarentee for the radio as this is seen as a reasonable running in period that would cover for any potential manufacturing defects to be covered by the manufacturer. As the vehicle is over 2 years outside of that period, we would reasonably suggest that this issue is not a manufacturing defect.  Visitor: Ok Joseph  Visitor: What else could it be?  Visitor: I have taken the car to 3 garages and contacted jeep and everyone apart from you seems to know there is a fault with the radios  Assistant: Thats not for me to say, I would invite you to have the unit inspected by a technician.  Visitor: As always the big companies behave poorly  Visitor: A radio of course should still be working  Visitor: But you we both know that and your job is obviously not to admit that so we will leave it there  Assistant: OK thank you for contacting us today.

;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hello i recently bought a Jeep advertised as a Jeep Partiot 2.0. it turns out that i was actually sold a modified Jeep Assistantnot the standard advertised Jeep Patriot SUV with the usual suspension and shock absorbers on it but instead a set of low profile racing suspension and shock absorbers. To disguise this the garage i bought it from had just placed 4 ned big tyres on that as a result when i took the 30 degree turn of the wheel left to turn onto the motorway home the back of the jeep lifted as the front-left wheel locked as it caught tightly up against the inner wheel arch almost rolling the badly modified Jeep with the wrong size wheels on. It was supposed to have low profile tires on the speedster rims that my friend and i i thought were simply new make of rims the previous owner had put on the Jeep as the Jeep rims were damage or whatever? I know discovered that it was a specially commissioned vehicle made in 2008, commissioned by the MD of Jeep at the time. Its a dangerous, insane idea that i now need to rectify in order to drive it safely. As the dealer refuses to refund me (i am taking him to trading standards and court) What i need from Jeep (HQ - ie you) as the local UK branches know nothing about this abomination is what suspension and shocks and rims and tyres SHOULD be on a standard Jeep Assistant2.0. In plain words i need to know what it was originally sold with and what my garage need to acquire in order to get the Jeep drivable with some clearance between the tire outer edge and the wheel arch. And to handle the road properly not like a tractor as it currently does. Apparently you the HQ are row the only mechanics that have the workshop manuals to guide us into how and what needs done to revert the Speedster back into what i thought i was buying. Diagrams from workshop manual with instructions and parts (with ALL part numbers) will be very much appreciated and required to reverse engineer the terrible attempt at making a speedster SUV out of a Jeep Patriot! Please help me was nobody else that works in Jeep i UK that i have found even know how to identify a speedster from a Patriot CRD other than the obviously silly low profile tyres but i seen to been the only person conned into buying such a monstrosity as they cannot found for sale not even in scrap yards anything linked to a jeep patriot speedster suv lowrider. Utter rubbish. Please don't give up un me i really need the part names so that i can get quotes for what is needed for the salesperson that sold it to me to repair it.

Compensation/goodwill for disease;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I purchased my vehicle on the 29 06 2018 from Jeep Simonstone Bristol Uk. I did return the car back to Simonstone under warranty for a problem with moisture within passenger side head light. Simonstone had the vehicle all afternoon and phoned me to come back and pick up my Vehicle. On arrival they said that the moisture would clear within a few hours. I replied that the moisture had been there for over a week and has never gone away and that I had all ready explained this the receptionist when I booked the car in and the mechanic when I dropped the car off. The mechanic and the manager explained that to fix the head light would be a massive job and the lights moisture would clear. A day or so after returning home I looked at the manual and discovered how to gain access to the light fitting by removing 3x bolts under the wheel arch, pulled back the cover and discovered that the cap had come off and I felt was disappointed that Simonstone could had dried the light out and reinstalled the cap. I dried out the unit with fan heater and re installed the cap with, if I remember correctly, a quarter of a turn. I phoned Simonstons and told them how to fix the problem but the receptionist wasn't interested. now the lightning unit as failed and face the problem of a £1200 bill. I think there is a possibility that this problem may have caused my current issue - is there anyway that Jeep could reduce the £1200 estimated bill for me?  Visitor: did you get the message  Visitor: hi Joseph, I realise it might take a while to sort this out. would it be easier for you to ask someone to phone me tomorrow on 01275 331025? Peter

Visitor: i need to know the ones in leicester  Assistant: my best advice to you is to contact your closest Jeep retailers, providing the vehicle's registration and mileage, and how many services it has had so far, and ask them for a quote.

Visitor: Tonbridge  Visitor: These are whom I've spoken with and they are waiting stock so really the question now is what is going on with the supply issue further up the line for the requirement to wait nearly 3 months for a cable  Assistant: As we now have the supplying retailer we will be able to look into this further  Visitor: OK. Do you have knowledge of the dimensions of the cable so I can have one fabricated locally and within a respectable time as I feel this could still takes months  Assistant: We do not have parts technical information available, we would look to see what the delay is and how we can manage that  Visitor: Thankyou for your time.

Visitor: Hi Joseph, I?m desperate to speak to someone but cannot get through on the phone?  Assistant: How can I help you today?

Visitor: The ref is 00860200  Assistant: ok thank you, just one moment  Assistant: OK, would you be able to let me know which retailer you have contacted for your vehicle order?  Visitor: I would rather speak to someone on the phone about that as I live on the Isle ofMan and we only have one retailer here. I would like to confirm with you first. My number is 07624 231915 if someone could call me please  Assistant: We have your initial email and I would like to escalate this to our case managers to call call you but first I would need to get some more information if thats ok. In this case I just need to know which retailer and then I will have the case sent to the case management team.  Visitor: I don?t want to get the retailer into trouble before I check with you. I?m a Motability customer and had found the perfect car after 4 months of looking and I ordered it and was then told that even though It?s a new model that you are not factory building any of these models anymore so I was heartbroken and I have to make a decision on a car by tomorrow morning at the latest so this is the urgency as to wanting to speak to somebody today from Jeep and I can?t seem to get through on the numbers? I would like to know why you are not building this model? Compass S 1.4 auto  Assistant: just on moment  Assistant: This must be a very recent change as this vehicle is listed for this quarter and I cannot see a product update in our system to say they are now longer buidling the vehicle.  Assistant: We will need to speak to the rretailer. I will not get them in trouble, they do not control our factory orders  Visitor: I was told that it could not be ordered and as I?ve gone above their heads by checking with you this could make it very difficult for me to order now. The only thing that it didn?t have was that it cannot take a hoist in the boot for my scooter which is disappointing but as long as it was this model and Automatic this CD is my top car. They said they rang and were told that you were not building any new and that there were none already built in an auto? The Motability person is called Sharne at MotorMall but if you speak to her she is not going to be happy with me at all.  Visitor: If this cannot be ordered then I am going to have to go to the Citroen garage and get a car I don?t really want so I need to know ASAP. This is going to be a problem for me  Assistant: The issue might be that we do not have factory orders for this vehicle but rather have a central stock, so if a line os sold out it might not be being replaced  Visitor: There was one in a U.K. depot but it was manual. Please could you find out for me as all these months of worry are taking their toll on me.  Assistant: I will get the case escalated, I will not escalate this as a reetailer complaint it is recorded as an issue with the availbility of the vehicle  Visitor: When will I hear back from you please?  Assistant: We need the case to get assigned so it can take up to 48 hours  Visitor: That will be no good as I need to re order a car by tomorrow. This is heartbreaking and has been a waste of both our times. I will have to go for a car I don?t want!  Assistant: Im sorry to hear that  Visitor: Is there no one that I can?t speak to now?  Assistant: We would need to have a case manager call you  Visitor: Well if that can?t be done today there is no point as I?ve run out of time. Good day  Assistant: Good day

Availability/codes and prices;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Hi Laura, my name is Craig I recently purchased a Jeep Cherokee 2.8CRD Assistant1J8GMC8585W646856 and note that there is no PIN in the vehicle handbook as there should be. Could you please provide it for me?  Assistant: Hi Craig,  Assistant: what would the PIN be for?  Visitor: In case a key is lost  Visitor: Apparently it is required to code the new key to the car. I have both keys but just want everything to be as it should be  Assistant: I will have to refer you to a Jeep authorised retailer in regards to this, they would be able to advise you. No codes are held at Customer Care, due to safety reasons  Assistant: would you need the details for a Jeep retailer near you?  Visitor: No but I am a little confused surely Jeep would hold vehicle information centrally since dealerships are just that they may be Jeep today and Ford tomorrow  Visitor: It would be VERY unsafe have vehicle data held at a dealership and causes me some concern  Assistant: I do not believe that the retailers would have the information at their premises, but they might be able to obtain a code, once they can provide the evidence that they are requesting it on behalf of the owner of the vehicle. I would suggest you in any case to contact the garage/person that you purchased the vehicle from, to enquire about the PIN. Be aware that in 2005 Jeep was not part of FCA, so we are unable to advise as to how and whether the PIN was provided to the original buyer of the car  Visitor: I appreciate your advice but I would be making a non essential journey to go to a 3rd party for them to tell Jeep I am the owner when here I am the registered legal owner of the vehicle. Who would a dealership obtain the code from, surely yourselves?  Assistant: I would suggest you to contact the retailer by phone, first of all, to see whether they can assist - any documentation could possibly be sent to them by email, the retailer has access to the technical / spare parts department , should the info be available from one of these 2 departments  Assistant: this type of technical information is not held, nor is made avaialble to us at Customer Care, hence why i would recommend you contact a Jeep retailer  Visitor: Could you please help me understand how Jeep operates. I can understand Customer Care not holding the information but where is the technical spares department? Is it on the same site as yourselves,in the UK or somewhere else? I don't understand what customer care provides if they just point owners to dealerships. My request I would say is simply administrational I am not asking a technical question like what are the torque settings on the cylinder head just the PIN that should have been with my car  Assistant: I am unable to advise further viat he webchat, you can either call on 00800 0426 5337, option 2 or email customercare.uk@fcagroup.com  Assistant: the PIN might have been given to the first owwenr , 16 years ago, ewe do not know, nor would we be able to advise what has happened to the PIN since.  Assistant: a Jeep retaielr would be able to advise how they can order and code a new key for you, in case you need it  Visitor: I appreciate that I just thought I was asking for something very simple and am finding that Jeep aftercare fails terribly in meeting my expectations  Assistant: I am sorry you feel this way Craig  Visitor: Thankfully I don't need a key and please be assured my frustration is not with you but the systems your company seems to have in place  Assistant: since there isn't a technical helpline for customers, the retailers are the best place to provide technical assistance and information , they have got the back up from the technical department in Jeep UK in case they need help  Visitor: One thing I am firmy of the opinion is I will never by a new Jeep or Chrysler product  Visitor: Perhaps Jeep should consider a technical helpline for the future  Visitor: Obviously you have done all you can to help and it is not your fault as I have said  Assistant: your feedback will be forwarded to the relevant departmen Craig  Visitor: Thank you I think it should be Laura. After owning more Landrovers than I care to mention I thought I would try a Jeep, a great vehicle but support is lacking terribly for older models.  Visitor: I have actually contacted my local dealerships to see what they could provide generally and both confessed they had never even worked on my model so had no experience. That is why I didn't ask about the PIN and thought I would contact Jeep directly. I think that would possibly be the most important information to feedback  Assistant: Noted Craig, thank you. Is there anything else that i can help you with today?

;Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: I have a Jeep Compass ref Wp69asv which I took into my dealer Arnold Clark in Perth scotland yesterday to fix problem with electric windows not working. They advised it required a new body computer which is on back order and could be months. On return of the car I now have several warning lights showing on the dashboard, the orange engine light stays on, a note saying check DEF system is coming up and the auto stop start light is lit up orange with an exclamation mark and is not working. Arnold Clark have said they do not have a courtesy car available until next month at the earliest I am reliant on the car living in a rural area so cannot be without it. Can you advise how to get this resolved as I am unhappy driving the car with the faulty computer and faults that appear to be occurring  Assistant: Hi,  Assistant: have you informed the retailer about this already?  Visitor: Yes I spoke to them this morning and they said to contact you  Assistant: because of all these warning lights, i would suggest you to get in touch with Roadside Assistance, they can send somebody out to you - the number is 0080004265337 opt 1, alternatively 0208 666 0627  Visitor: Is that service provided under the warranty  Assistant: your vehicle has got a 3 year rsa coverage , starting from the date of 1st registration  Assistant: is it a lease vehicle or is it registered under your name?  Visitor: My name  Assistant: can i have your details please?  Visitor: Colin seath, laggan farm cottage, crieff Ph7 4jl 07803050595  Assistant: thank you,  Assistant: i was looking on the map, but there are no other retailers close to you, perth is the nearest one, alternatively dundee or falkirk Colin, so I would definitely recommend to contact Roadside  Visitor: Is the car safe to drive with these warnings showing  Assistant: I am not able to tell you unfortunately, when it comes to warning lights , it is always advisable to get the vhl plugged in to the diagnostics machine, that will read out the fault codes - only at that point a technician is able to advise on the necessary repairs or if the car is safe to drive  Visitor: Ok but given that Arnold Clark have already said the body computer is faulty and needs replacement can you provide a replacement vehicle until the part is available which they say might be months and it appears that this is causing other functions to fail  Assistant: if the retailer does not have a courtesy car to give you, they can put the request through on a specific system that all Jeep retailers have got access to, for a loan car that is normally provided through enterprise - it is not something that can be done by us as we do not have the facility to request this. We would only be able to extend the loan car until necessary, if the repairs are covered under warranty  Visitor: Ok thanks I will ask Arnold Clark to organise that, and in meantime will contact RSA to look at the faults  Assistant: the vehicle needs to be off the road at an authorised Jeep retailer, before they can request the loan car. if you contact RSA, they will send somebody out to you ASAP and get the vehicle recovered  Visitor: That leaves me stranded without a car  Assistant: You will have to get the vehicle back to the retailer, either driving it there, or recovered by RSA , for the whole process to start I am afraid  Visitor: Ok I will speak to Arnold Clark again  Assistant: perfect - feel free to contact us back if necessary Colin

I have taken the vehicle to a third party diagnostic specialist who advises that the problem relates to a faulty NOX sensor on the exhaust system. Possible replacement costs estimated at circa £1500.00 - can you advise if this sensor has an expected lifespan ( the vehicle has done 27000 miles ) and has been serviced entirely through your dealership network.  Assistant: I would not be able to say that a part has an expected life span. Have you contacted the servicing retailer with the information from the independent?  Visitor: Yes with very little assistance given - they advised I contact Jeep direct.  Assistant: Which retailer are you referring to and have you owned the vehicle from new?  Visitor: The dealership is noew Stoneacre in Scotswood Rd in Newcastle - the vehicle was purchased new from Richard Hardie that held the franchise at the same location in 2017  Assistant: At this stage, if our retailer has nt diagnosed a fault on the vehicle then we would not be able to assist further. If Stoneacre agree to rellok at the vehicle and find this nox sensor issue then we could discuss this with them.  Assistant: Alternatively you could present the vehicle to an alternative Jeep retailer  Visitor: Happy to do either - I suggest Stoneacre being the first option as they serviced the vehicle - do I make reference to this on line chat session by quoting F15290A or do you advise them direct.  Assistant: The case raised for this chat would be 00817630, however I would close this case for now waiting on confirmation as to whether SToneacre or another retailer have faulted the vehicle,  Visitor: ok many thanks I will now contact Stoneacre to book the vehicle in for a further review.  Assistant: OK, thank you for contacting us today, let me know if you need anything else

Deadlines and maintenance schedule;"Assistant: Hello , my name is Assistant, please note that chats may recorded for training or quality assurance purposes. How may I help you today?  Visitor: Good afternoon.. My name is FrankHewitt  Visitor: During the last 15 years I have purchased 7 Jeeps ? 3 Patriots, I Cherokee and 3 Grand Cherokees.(Mostly new cars) I am, therefore, disappointed that, on the only occasion on which I have sought the help of Jeep UK, I have received no assistance, nor indeed the courtesy of a response to a very simple request for information. Perhaps this, my third attempt, will prompt such a courtesy. I am currently in the West of Ireland, approximately 100 miles from the nearest Jeep dealer. I need urgently to change the oil and filter in my current Jeep ? 2017 Jeep Cherokee 2.2 litre Multijet Reg: HGZ 5714 ? but cannot locate the oil filter. Last week I emailed Jeep Customer service with a request for detailed info on the filter location. I also sent a message on Twitter. Both communications have been ignored to date. Would you please send me a description ? preferably with diagram ? to enable me to locate and change the filter. AssistantFrank Hewitt  Assistant: Diagrams are not available to Customers. We do have a website where you can access this information but is exclusively for operators in the sector (in possession of the VAT registration number) and not for privates and is designed to answer queries of independent repairers, or repairers outside of the official network of the Fiat Brand (technical queries, special equipment, diagnostic systems and for training with the same terms defined for the official Network).  Assistant: www.technicalinformation.fiat.com  Assistant: Otherwise, we will invite you to contact a Jeep Authorised retailer and book the vehicle in.  Assistant: Would you like me to locate the closest retailer to you?  Visitor: I am 100 miles from the nearest Jeep dealer and i do need to change my oil and filter. All I need is for someone to tell me where the filter is located  Assistant: You are contacting Customer services. For technical support you must refer to a Jeep retailer.  Assistant: You are not obliged to have your vehicle serviced at an Authorised Retailer; should you choose to have your vehicle maintained independently, we would strongly advise that a detailed record is kept. Please note it is vitally important that the correct grade of oil is used and recorded and also the parts must be of a quality that meets the standard of our genuine MOPAR components.  Assistant: Can I help you with anything else at this time?  Visitor: Perhaps the CEO of FCA would be prepared to provide a little more help. Can i have a print out of this email?  Assistant: When terminating the chat, you will be able to request a copy of the transcript.  Visitor: Thank you  Visitor: How do I terminate?  Assistant: You are most welcomed, thank you for chatting with us today."

Visitor: I refer you to my contact with F1529)A Joseph on 19.04.21.  Visitor: A case number was registered 00817630 regarding a failed NOX 2 sensor.  Visitor: I have had the Stoneacre dealership in Scorswood Rd Newcastle confirm the third party finding that this sensor is the cause of the EML warning on the dashboard. Therefore I ask my original query of what do you consider the life cycle of this sensor as this has faied on a vehicle with only 27000 miles on the clock and within 4 years of first purchase. The cost of replacement has been quoted as £1298.24 by the dealership and I enquire if Jeep will consider replacement FOC or contribute to the replacement of this sensor.  Assistant: With this type of request, regrettably we would not be in a position to investigate through the chat facility. In order for us to further invstigate, we kindly ask that you contact our Customer Care team either by phone on: 0080004265337 or by email: customercare.uk@fcagroup.com
